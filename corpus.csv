Reddit;How many years of top-level club football do you think Messi has left in him?;movin4call;2023/01/06;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/104ddwr/how_many_years_of_toplevel_club_football_do_you/;No, this is not meant to be negative. Just curious.Messi has won everything possible at club and international level. He can now play with a free spirit so I expect him to play really well with PSG.But Father Time is undefeated. Even Ronaldo ended up moving to Asia at his age.While he is undoubtedly at the back end of his career, he is still brilliant. He no longer runs as much and hardly presses as much also. Even if he loses his ability to score goals, I expect him to stay on top as one of the greatest passers of all time. The man has a brilliant mind to see runs and make pinpoint passes.I am curious how many years Messi has left to play top-level club football in Europe (competing for Champions League). What do you think?

Reddit;Should I keep playing football or look for a new hobby?;PangolinOk3665;2023/01/06;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/104e135/should_i_keep_playing_football_or_look_for_a_new/;"Should I stick with this sport?Hey guys. I've been playing this sport since I was 4 and continued up unto junior year in Highschool (17). From senior year to age 21 I took a 3 year hiatus from the game to focus on college and work. I came back to it in September of 2022 and started playing with a really good team. We don't play official matches, but we train very hard to improve our game. Scrimmages get very intense. We have guys from Africa, Europe, Mexico, and South America playing with us. The games used to be really fun, but I'm really struggling with imposter syndrome to be honest. If you fuck up and lose the ball, they get onto you immediately. Every time I receive the ball I just want to pass it off, or take a shot so I don't have to carry it. The anxiety I experience makes playing the game horrible.When I'm playing with friends or a pick up game, I usually score between 8-10 goals just having fun, but during these training sessions with the team, I only get 2 or 3.Some guys start yelling at me, or saying I need to work harder. I don't mind constructive criticism, it's just when I hear them say don't pass the ball to me, or when they yell at me or say: ""What the fuck are you doing!?""...I just want to say screw it...I'll go train by myself.I don't plan on being a professional, I just want to play to have fun, stay fit and improve my game. It used to be a sport I could use to get away from my worries at work and life, now I go there just to get stressed out. Again, I'm not against tough coaching and criticism or even anxiety, I just can't deal with the  stress anymore.Should I find a new hobby? Or just man up and stick with the team?"

Reddit;[Liverpool] Even with the injuries, Klopp has a lot of options for midfielders.

But whatever they are doing is obviously not working. Other teams are able to easily get behind them and attack our four defenders on fast counter attacks.   I guess I’m asking is why does Klopp not change his midfield in any way the last few games. Put in some of the younger players like Carvalho or the three academy kids. Or even put one of our defenders in a sweeper position.   I guess I’m just confused why he isn’t trying to try new things when it is glaringly obvious we have a gaping hole in the center. So in summary can someone explain to me why he doesn’t use a new set up and sticks with the same three?

Reddit;Players who would be more globally know had they’ve been of a different nationality?;Great_Individual673;2023/01/05;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/1045s8z/players_who_would_be_more_globally_know_had/;In Peru, we have several players who are wildly known domestically and perhaps even in the continental level, previously Paolo Guerrero and now Christian Cueva and Gianluca Lapadula. However I imagine the vast majority of soccer fans worldwide don’t know about them (maybe heard of Lapadula back in 2016 when he was in Milan). In the 2018 WC, I felt many fans thought of Peru kinda like Panama as both didn’t have well known players even though Peru is a level up. Kinda feel Peruvians would have had a chance to become better known had Cueva converted his penalty against Denmark in 2018 (might have made Peru end up 4 points while Denmark would have had 3 had all other results  stayed the same.)I also think of how many Moroccan players like Boufal and Ounahi been little known globally before the tournament. Are there other players you feel would have been more well known had they’ve been of a different nationality or had gone further in the World Cup?

I'd like to ask you kindly if there's a way to ask for some autographed cards to European teams (so I wanna know if there's something similar to what happens with F1 teams, to whom who follow F1 too, maybe you know what I'm talking about). I have some teams that I hugely support since I was very little, but I don't mind getting autographs from footballers playing for other teams, as I am a massive football fan above all and I do admire talents regardless of the jersey they are wearing. I'm from Italy, so maybe it might be easier to ask for them, if there's the possibiliy, innit?
Reddit;Place of South America in World Football!?;Great_Individual673;2023/01/05;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/1044v5q/place_of_south_america_in_world_football/;When I was little, I used to think of South America as joint with Europe as the heavyweights of  the sport. However as I grew older, was disappointed in seeing that UEFA is seen as up and away the most dominant region and CONMEBOL is arguably more on the level of other regions like AFC, CAF and CONCACAF. While Argentina won the most recent WC, the Argentine league is arguably becoming less and less relevant and many of its top players are now going to MLS and not one of the top 5 European leagues. The Brazilian league is the most financially strong but even it can’t compete with MLS or now the Saudi Pro League for players heavy in marketing. In the World economy too, Latin America is becoming seen as irrelevant due to having a smaller population and less economic growth compared to Asia and Africa. Football is something where they generally stood out but not as much as in past decades. I also feel Brazil (in 2000s)and Argentina (in 2020s) were able to win the World Cup in eras of where they dominated regional competition. In the 2010s where Uruguay, Chile and Colombia got more to their level, Argentina and Brazil struggled more with the top European teams.

Reddit;Why is Messi reduced to just stats now while other players that create magic like Ronaldinho, Zidane or Maradona didn't face this issue?;spexyg;2023/01/05;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/103ozch/why_is_messi_reduced_to_just_stats_now_while/;I hate the fact that old players like Ronaldinho, Zidane, Garrincha, Maradona, Cryuff aren't considered legends or even GOATs during the time for their stats specifically but for how they owned in the pitch, but when it comes to Messi now, a lot of people reduce Messi down solely into his stats as if sports is Maths. Ofcourse he is statistically better than everyone but he still has the same magic factor or even better actually than many legends. Certain plays these old legendary magicians like Ronaldinho, Garrincha, Zidane did weren't even on the stats because their play might result in a goal but might not even be an actual stat that is compared right? Also football is a team game afterall anyone's mistake can result in a miss afterall but that doesn't mean the player contributing a pass didn't do his part, he did it perfectly there too. If they check stats for that like goals and assists then being called football legends would make no sense especially comparing to Ronaldo and Messi's stats in Europe.Messi can do all of this together in the same time: He can do what Pirlo, Zidane, Kaka, Iniesta, Modric, Xavi etc do by being an insane playmaker from a deeper role with insane vision. He can dribble and create magic like Maradona, Garrincha and Ronaldinho could. He has more assists than all dedicated attacking free role creators like Ozil, David Silva, De Bruyne and more. And after all of this, he scores goals against and competes with goalscoring legends like Ronaldo, Pele etc. Ronaldo is compared to Messi with stats, which looks good for Ronaldo in the eyes of a casual. But with that logic, like I said, Ronaldinho, Zidane, Iniesta, Cruyff etc would never be legends because stats wise they aren't as good, longetivity wise too! Even Ronaldo and Suarez has more assists than Iniesta because they are in the attacking 3. It's sad that media forgets to look at Messi's magic that is similar to all these legends while comparing him to literally anyone. They just check stats like robots.Also what if someone like Haaland actually get better stats by banging goals and people from the next generation thinks he's better just because Messi was unfairly reduced to just stats? People are even comparing Messi to Mbappe based on stats now even if 9/13 goals Mbappe scored were Messi assists this season and no one would remember it in the future incase Mbappe gets better stats, which I don't think will happen because Messi at 24 scored 91 goals and Mbappe even if he is leading now will have lesser goals than Messi having played more matches by next December. But again these are just stats, based on how I've seen them play, they don't seem as magical.A robot would call Ronaldo's individual stats comparable to Messi, but has humans, we have the brain and logic to understand so much more than the final output, Messi's gamesense, decisions, how he creates a chance out 0% chance (like the pass against Netherlands and the goals where he dribble 5-6 players) should be more thought of. But the insane part is Ronaldo as of now has 142 games more than Messi and still only has SIXTEEN GOALS MORE. So maybe Ronaldo will score so much in Saudi and keep the goals record but as of now even a robot would say Messi's stats are better even if they reduce it to just stats which is also so crazy to me?So I hope when someone praises Messi later on, they put some weight on the fact that Messi isn't just stats, isn't just assists or goals but instead equally it should be mentioned that he has the same magic factor the legends who didn't have impressive stats on paper had. Even if Messi is better than everyone as of now purely on stats, that shouldn't hover over how good he is as a magician like Maradona and Ronaldinho is.
Reddit;Lautaro 22 is basically Higuain 14;themanfromthere12;2023/01/05;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/103zg2t/lautaro_22_is_basically_higuain_14/;Lautaro had a good presence on the field, he could fight for the ball and keep possession. But in terms of scoring opportunities conversation, he reminded me of Higuain from 2014.  After failing to perform in the opening match against SA he was benched. Against Australia he had some abysmal misses. In the final after coming on in the extra time, he managed to squander another two great opportunities. He was set up with a great shooting chance inside the box, but took too much time and allowed a French defender to block his shot. And in the dying minutes of extra time he was set up with a perfect soft cross, and somehow managed to head it completely wide.Edit: and forgot to mention, even when they scored the third goal Lautaro made a wrong decision and was lucky that it ended up in the net. After receiving the ball in the box, instead of passing to Messi who was wide open, he chose to take a shot from a very hard angle, a shot that Lloris managed to stop, and it was only a pure luck that the ball fell to Messi who managed to score at the rebound.
Reddit;How good exactly is Mbappe to you in terms of technique ONLY?;KazamaShintaro7;2023/01/05;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/103y4lw/how_good_exactly_is_mbappe_to_you_in_terms_of/;Mbappe is a very polarising player in this area. By some he is compared to R9 who is one of the most technically gifted players ever. By others he is called a pace merchant who can just run fast.Now in my estimation he’s not really on R9’s level in technique BUT definitely not a pace merchant. I’ve seen him do things that are pretty R9-esque with the ball that don’t involve his speed. I recall his games vs Madrid last year his last minute goal in the first leg and this R9-esque dummy to Courtois to score a goal that was disallowed and ofc the little dribbling run in the final play of the game vs Argentina in extra time.I’ve seen him compared to guys like Bale but I think Mbappe is a lot better in creating something out of nothing when pace is out the window. (Not calling Bale a pace merchant tho ofc). He can be clumsy at times but have a pretty elegant first touch on other occasions.

Through this they can review certain decisions if they feel the on field ref got it wrong. For Penalties, Red Cards ( maybe Yellow cards if second yellow for a player) only ofcourse to reduce time wastage. No need for the stupid If they get it wrong they lose the review, but it is retained if they get it right. Would help a lot with managers and players aggrievement. Innit?

Reddit;Could Erling Haaland win the Ballon D'or ahead of favourite Messi if he wins the ucl, premier league, FA Cup and EFL cup?;Highiqcells2;2023/01/04;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/102obmv/could_erling_haaland_win_the_ballon_dor_ahead_of/;"Before the World Cup, Erling Haaland has been one of the most talked about players since his move to premier league champions Man city. He is on track to breaking Salah's record of 32 goals in a season and also holds a good spot in UCl with City and is in a good spot in the UCL golden boot with currently Kylian Mbappe being on top. Talking about Mbappe, I do not think Kylian Mbappe could win the ballon Dor due to the fact he shares the same team (PSG) and spotlight with Lionel Messi and with thr world cup golden ball,World cup and 2nd in ranking in golden boot race Messi is in the lead of Mbappe by a big margin in terms of winning the Ballon Dor if only world Cup were included in Ballon Dor rankings. The only possible loophole Mbappe could take to have a chance is probably if Messi gets an injury or outshines him by a great margin in UCL football. If not Mbappe is just helping Messi get his 8th Ballon dor with every goal that he scores.Back to Erling Haaland though. Man City are one of the favourites alongside PSG and Bayern Munich and Haaland is shining in that team and Man city are regarded as the ""best"" team in the world right now. If all adds up he could win the UCL probaly also picking up the golden boot in the process. The premier League however may be tougher for Man city. Arsenal are strong favourites after going 8 points clear of City playing 1 game more. However City are known for making comebacks in the last 10 years, so if Pep Guardiola can sort out the team for the league he could see himself win the league with the golden boot especially with the squa depth that team has compared to other title challengers. FA and EFL cup are also competitions City are favourites in. And Haaland could easily pick them up if he plays in those competitions. Also with City squad depth they will probably dominate in FA and EFL cup with a B team. With that in mind Haaland has a high chance of winning every major trophy in english football this season with City in turn giving his a very high chance of winning the ballon dor. However this is a what if scenario, many things could go wrong or other team and players way and we still have a long season until 2023 ballon dor is announced around October, so we just got to witness and watch the beatiful game.But if lets say this did happen, who do you think would be the winner of ballon dor? Messi? Haaland? or Mbappe? or someone else?"

What/Who to watch?;rjpena322;2023/01/04;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/1033r6m/new_football_fan_whatwho_to_watch/;I watched the World Cup and became intrested in football. I only know the a few players like Messi, Ronaldo, and Neymar. I now watch football on my spare time and slowly liking the sport. I am now beginning to slowly understand the rules and terminologies by through watching  a lot of games of popular teams like Real Madrid and Barcelona. What teams do you suggest I watch aside from La Liga? Thanks. I'm thinking of buying a replica kit. I'm still confused by the offside rule though.
Reddit;If Ronaldo wins a AFC CL and Messi stays on 4 UCL, would CR7 get back into the GOAT conversation?;None;2023/01/05;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/103qyi7/if_ronaldo_wins_a_afc_cl_and_messi_stays_on_4_ucl/;So technically speaking Messi does have 4 ucl medals however he only played and been instrumental in 3 of those wins (rode on Ronaldinho and Etoo coat tails in 06 with addition to being injured). While on the other hand CR7 has been to 6 finals with 5 medals and has been instrumental in all 6 and played a big role in all finals played, 6 to Messi's 3. He also holds the most goals in knockouts, all time, finals, top scorer and especially the BIG 3 PEAT in the UCL. Surely this should be counted as something towards the finale of the GOAT discussion. UCL is the most premier competitive tournament in the world club football, reaching 6 finals being the main man compared to 3 is a big difference. A 3 peat beats 2 trebles in 7 seasons imo also. You cannot choose which country you are born in and Argentina historically has a rich trophy cabinet so to win a copy America isn't as big as a Euros win (1st International trophy ever for Portugal) and Argentina no doubt holds far more quality players in each generation Messi has played in, Riqueleme, Aguero, Higuain, Tevez, Di Maria, Alvarez, Mascherano, Ayala, Heinze, Cambiasso, Crespo, Milito (Both), Veron, Samuel, Zabaleta, Maxi Rodriguez etcWhile Ronaldo has had Quaresma, Pepe, Figo, Pauleta, Nani, Moutinho, Coentrao, Simao, Deco, Leao, Felix, Fernandes, Dias, Cancelo, Bernardo Silva - last 7 players came from the last World Cup only! Quality and history wise, Messi should have been able to win a copa while reaching at least the semi finals was always expected of the Argentines. What Ronaldo essentially did was win with a team that was not expected to like Denmark or Greece or Chile which makes it much more of a accomplishment. World Cup shouldn't define the GOAT debate.

However could you argue Pele prior to his passing was self absorbed and inflated his own success at the expense of others? There seems to be more than meets the eye with his 3x world cup successes, which at face value is an outstanding feat not soon to be replicated, but is his contribution overblown? Names like Garrincha, Didi, Jarzinho and a plethora of others in a highly talented Brazilian team contributed just as much if not more at a time when Brazil dominated world football.I feel his media presence over the years has promoted his legacy as an undisputed 'legend'  and played on our nostalgia. His career never had the controversy of Maradona and Garrincha and as a result capitalised on this contrast to raise his own legacy. Albeit never saw him play but I've recently taken an interest in him and haven't found a discussion about this on this sub. Curious to hear your thoughts.

Reddit;What do you think about a revolutionary approach to managing a football club? Read below!;SunFull9303;2023/01/03;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/102942e/what_do_you_think_about_a_revolutionary_approach/;"Hello, guys. I am a manager with ten years of experience managing a professional football team (in the Italian 3rd division). After my most recent experience, a distinct idea has stuck in my head, and I would want to hear your thoughts on it.In these ten years, I've come to the realization—and it's not a big realization—that practically any football company's toughest task isn't to win games, it's to **SURVIVE**. This assertion is more accurate the lower the level, but if you think about it, even the biggest football team has significant financial problems. This is due to the fact that football frequently has costs that are larger than profits, and this anti-economic circumstance is practically unique in the market.However, it should be remembered that football is a ""normal"" company just like the film industry, and **that its product, ENTERTAINMENT,** must be promoted and sold to its maximum potential, to make profits.The same methods are used by all football teams nowadays to generate revenue: player trading, sponsorships, merchandising, and that's about it. However, in my opinion, this is insufficient to produce a steady and sufficient amount of money.  So, I was thinking recently that it's necessary to develop a cutting-edge strategy to turn a club into a successful business, and that in order to do so, we must ""**invent the wheel**,"" in the sense of finding a **cutting-edge approach** to ""carry"" the revenue (The same approach that the ancient people took when they discovered that carrying things was too tiring).There are billions of soccer enthusiasts worldwide, and millions of FIFA, Football Manager players pay millions to simulate running THEIR CLUB.I believe there would be a huge market for a club (a new club), which allows his fans (or members, partners, etc.) to **truly feel like a manager**, adopting a **really inclusive marketing strategy**, intended to maximize the selling of the real product of football, which is, as I previously stated: ENTERTAINMENT.This club would market football as entertainment (and not as a religion), as well as enjoyment, local experiences, and so on.The goal would be to give you the impression that you are a manager, scout, or even a coach (do you know about the ""IKEA EFFECT""?).What are your thoughts on this vision?"

Reddit;My thoughts on Liverpools attack this season;itisme1256;2023/01/03;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/101rx2h/my_thoughts_on_liverpools_attack_this_season/; As we all know far too well, it hasn't been the greatest season for us so far. But even more worryingly, it doesn't seem like this team has the key elements needed to re-start our season and drive us into top 4 contention. Throughout the season all 3 key aspects of attack, midfield and defence have been at best inconsistent and at worst woeful. A lot has been said about our need for new signings and I fully agree that at least 2 new midfielders are needed in the next couple of transfer windows, however for now (as it doesn't look likely that there will be a new signing this January) we need to work with what we have.Attack: A lot has been said about our lack of potency this season, and particularly about Nunez and his inconsistent finishing. But for me more worrying is the lack of cohesion that can be seen in our front 3. One of the greatest things about Firmino, Salah and Mane (plus Jota and Diaz later on) was their suitability to any attacking role - Mane being a great example who often transitioned between all three positions within a game. And I just don't see that with this current attack. Salah has been relegated to a much wider, conventional winger role (although when he has got through the middle he has been devastating, such as against Rangers), Firmino isn't the player he used to be and Nunez lacks the basic technical ability to be a true successor to Mane - and this use of him as a focal point means that the role of Salah, Diaz and Firmino is massively diminished. Although the signing of Gakpo is a step in the right direction, and Klopp looks to be building a fantastic, young and talented attack for the future, right now there isn't the threat there has been over the past 5 years - we simply don't look like scoring 2 or even 3 times a game without mistakes from the opposing team (or in the case of Leicester, 2 own goals).

The huge differences in key things like training to begin with, and furthermore in how much players are worth, or how much they earn is mad, let alone the rules and VAR. Or even some basic things: the amount of images and videos we have to watch the older players is quite few compared to that of nowadays. Even old people might do not have that clear images in their mind from those years.It's like asking 'was Hippocrates a better doctor than René Favaloro?' The change medicine had undergone is brutal for that question to be resolved and though of course the change in football isn't that big, it has to be taken into account.

Reddit;Mbappé sayings about South American football being underdeveloped compared with the European football triggered several people... but is it true?;idontdomath8;2022/12/31;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zzmdvb/mbappé_sayings_about_south_american_football/;"The date was May 25th 2022. Mbappé was giving [an interview to TNT Sports Brazil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NCCrRMca_0) and he said a phrase that touched many, **many** people in South America:**Original (in French):**>""L'avantage qu'on a nous les Européens, c'est qu’on joue toujours entre nous, et on a des matchs de haut niveau, comme par exemple la Ligue des Nations. Quand on arrive à la Coupe du Monde, on est prêts. Là où le Brésil et l'Argentine n'ont pas ce niveau-là en Amérique du Sud. Le football n'est pas aussi avancé qu'en Europe. C'est pour ça que lors des dernières Coupes du monde, ce sont toujours les Européens qui ont gagné.""**Translation (in English):**>""The advantage we Europeans have is that we always play between us, in high level matches like the Nations League. When we arrive to the World Cup, we are ready. Brazil and Argentina don't have that level in South America. The football is not as advanced as here in Europe. That's why the last World Champions are always Europeans.""Lautaro Martínez, Richarlison, Fabinho and multiple other South American players replied to his sayings by pointing that the football level in the Conmebol is pretty high and the extra difficulties (like weather, altitude) made the matches pretty intense. But if we check the facts... **is it true what Mbappé said?**I'll do my best to don't be biased in this analysis (since I'm Argentinian) so I'll focus purely in results and stats, what aren't subjectives at all. I'll check four different but related topics, the **WC best performances**, **WC worst performances, WC mean performances** and **head to head results**, for the last 4 World Cups (I think there's no point to check results for +15 years ago if the debate is about nowadays performance).# World Cup best performances:The first point to check is the best teams of every one of these 4 World Cups, so we'll take a look to the teams that completed the 7 games in each tournament, the semi-finalists.* South Africa 2010: Uruguay, Netherlands, Germany, Spain* Brazil 2014: Brazil, Germany, Argentina, Netherlands* Russia 2018: France, Belgium, Croatia, England* Qatar 2022: Argentina, Croatia, France, Morocco.If we sum up the results for each confederation, we have 11 UEFA teams, 4 Conmebol teams and 1 CAF team, clear advantage for Europe. But we must take into account how many slots each confederation has, because there are different amounts of qualified teams from each continent. For the last 4 World Cups, the slots assigned were the same in each tournament:* AFC: 4.5 teams (\~14% out of 32).* CAF: 5 teams (\~16% out of 32).* Concacaf: 3.5 teams (\~11% out of 32).* Conmebol: 4.5 teams (\~14% out of 32).* OFC: 0.5 teams (\~2% out of 32).* UEFA: 13 teams (\~41% out of 32).So, considering the percentage of participants from each confederation, in 4 World Cups would be expected to have 6.5 semi-finalists from UEFA and 2.2 semi-finalists from Conmebol. Clearly, because of the low level from CAF, AFC, Concacaf and OFC, both UEFA and Conmebol are overperforming, almost by doubling the expected semi-finalists in 4 tournaments.# World Cup worst performances:The only way to see the worst performances in the tournaments is using the **final standings table** (although I'm not a big fan of it, I believe that it doesn't really represent the performances of the teams). Because of having much more teams qualified, it's expected that there will be UEFA teams in lower positions compared to Conmebol teams, but how many European teams were *worst* than the worst South American team in every World Cup?**South Africa 2010:*** Worst team from Conmebol: Chile (10th)* UEFA teams lower than 10th: 10 teams (77%) - Portugal (11th), England (13th), Slovakia (16th), Slovenia (18th), Switzerland (19th), Serbia (23rd), Denmark (24th), Greece (25th), Italy (26th), France (29th).**Brazil 2014:*** Worst team from Conmebol: Ecuador (17th)* UEFA teams lower than 17th: 7 teams (54%) - Portugal (18th), Croatia (19th), Bosnia (20th), Italy (22nd), Spain (23rd), Russia (24th), England (26th).**Russia 2018:*** Worst team from Conmebol: Peru (20th)* UEFA teams lower than 20th: 4 teams (31%) - Germany (22nd), Serbia (23rd), Poland (25th), Iceland (28th).**Qatar 2022:*** Worst team from Conmebol: Uruguay (20th)* UEFA teams lower than 20th: 4 teams (31%) - Belgium (23rd), Denmark (28th), Serbia (29th), Wales (30th).We can get from this information that there are always several European teams in the bottom of the final standings, and even the worst South American teams tend to be at least at mid of the table.# World Cup mean performances:Again, using the same **final standings table**, we can check easily which is the mean position for every confederation in every World Cup, just by grabbing every team for each continent together and then getting the mean position. The results are the following:**South Africa 2010:*** AFC: 4 teams, average position: 20th.* CAF: 5 teams, average position: 22nd.* Concacaf: 3 teams, average position: 19th.* Conmebol: 5 teams, average position: 7th.* OFC: 1 team, average position: 22nd.* UEFA: 13 teams, average position: 16th.**Brazil 2014:*** AFC: 4 teams, average position: 29th.* CAF: 5 teams, average position: 22nd.* Concacaf: 3 teams, average position: 16th.* Conmebol: 5 teams, average position: 8th.* OFC: no teams.* UEFA: 13 teams, average position: 15th.**Russia 2018:*** AFC: 4 teams, average position: 21st.* CAF: 5 teams, average position: 24nd.* Concacaf: 3 teams, average position: 24th.* Conmebol: 5 teams, average position: 11th.* OFC: no teams.* UEFA: 13 teams, average position: 12th.**Qatar 2022:*** AFC: 4 teams, average position: 20th.* CAF: 5 teams, average position: 16nd.* Concacaf: 3 teams, average position: 24th.* Conmebol: 4 teams, average position: 12th.* OFC: no teams.* UEFA: 13 teams, average position: 15th.The average position of every confederation help us see how good they perform in every World Cup in general, where we can see that despite the fact that 3 out of the last 4 champions are European, there are several teams with a level so low that makes the mean UEFA position be lower than the mean Conmebol position in every World Cup (even in Russia where the 4 semi-finalists where European).# Head to headsLast but not least (indeed, I think this is the most important topic) we should see every match where a South American team faced an European one. If we check the records for each of the last 4 World Cups, we could see the following results:* South Africa 2010: 3-3-6* Brazil 2014: 8-2-5* Russia 2018: 4-4-5* Qatar 2022: 4-4-1* **Total: 19-13-17**So we can see that in general the Conmebol teams perform slightly better against UEFA teams. Many people tend to say that Argentina and Brazil carry the full confederation, so let's remove both from this head-to-heads and check again the records. We end up with:* South Africa 2010: 2-2-4* Brazil 2014: 4-1-2* Russia 2018: 3-1-3* Qatar 2022: 0-1-1* **Total: 9-5-10**The result is that the record is practically even again, in this scenario with the Europeans ahead just by one match. But doing this last research makes me think that it's unfair removing the best performing teams from South America but considering every team from Europe. We could also say that the big UEFA teams from the last 4 World Cups carried the whole confederation, like Germany, France and the Netherlands. So if we remove those 3 teams too we get these final record:* South Africa 2010: 2-1-2* Brazil 2014: 4-0-1* Russia 2018: 3-1-1* Qatar 2022: 0-0-1* **Total: 9-2-5**In this scenario we can see a more clear difference in favor of South American teams, who have won almost twice as the European teams. So we can conclude that the mid-level teams in Conmebol have an advantage over the mid-level teams in UEFA.# Final thoughtsAfter doing all this research my personal conclusion is that Mbappé sayings weren't just out of the line, but they were also incorrect. It is true that 4 out of the last 5 World Cup champions were European, but it's also true that UEFA has almost 3 times the slots that Conmebol has, and when they face each other there is almost no difference (I could even say that the South American teams perform better). It is also true that there were fantastic European teams in the last World Cups, and maybe the reason why most of the champions came from UEFA was because the big Conmebol teams (Argentina and Brazil) couldn't get solid teams in the last tournaments, and since there are much less South American teams, most of the continent hopes resides in just a pair of teams (despite the fact that teams like Uruguay, Paraguay and Colombia made great appearances). And finally, there are many, **many** European teams that have a pretty lame level, who usually finish in the last standings of each World Cup, and they are also part of Europe, and when talking about UEFA we must also consider them, not just the big teams that we all know about.What are your opinions on this subject? I'll also try to post this in r/soccer and r/worldcup, just in case that it's not approved by some of the mods."
Reddit;Am I the only one who thinks the Mbappè/Real Madrid was a lot more complicated than people make it out to be.;KazamaShintaro7;2022/12/31;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zzgndp/am_i_the_only_one_who_thinks_the_mbappèreal/;From what i’ve seen a lot of people think that he turned down Madrid purely for the money. But based Mbappé’s history prior to that transfer suggested he was a person who stuck to his morals and to a degree he still does.We’re talking about a guy who refused to be in commercials for the French team because of what they promoted. I.e Fast Food, Gambling etc. He also hid the Heineken logo from his man of the match trophies. Real Madrid apparently didn’t allow him as much control over his image rights.The biggest think I want to talk about though is the politics involved… he received calls from people like Nicolas Sarkozy (Former French President) and Macron (Current President) urging him to stay. He is the pride and joy of France and probably their most talented player since Zidane. I can only imagine the pressure that he had not only from his nation but from country leaders themselves. It’s a lot for a guy who was only 23 at the time. I think the money could have been part of it but it’s an oversimplification at the same time.

Messi was just huge in this WC. The Mexico game changed everything for Argentina.Mbappè between his performances vs Real Madrid in 2022 (even if he lost) and the composure to hit those two penalties in arguably the most high pressure situations i’ve seen for a footballer was just amazing and that volley was simply *chefs kiss* can’t think of any 23 year old player who could perform do THAT under such circumstances.Modric I would also say truly has ice in his veins.

I highly doubt that if he chose to stay in Europe that he would achieve anything significant, also I don't think he would be a starter at a top club and I don't think he would settle for that.  Also how would his move damage in anyway his legacy? 5 Ballon Dors, 5 CLs, 4 golden shoes, Euro Cup, and countless other trophies and records. LOL what is there left for him to prove at age 38?And also just so you know, Pele decided to move to MLS at 35 yo, and as you see his legacy is fine.Edit: I understand that his European career didn't end as nicely as he would want to. Since he left Madrid he was playing mostly for himself without committing to anyone, and once it got rocky both in Juve and MU he ran to the door. But that's CR7 for you, always has been.

Reddit;European football fans have the shortest memories of all sports fans.;cemma2035;2022/12/31;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zzisjt/european_football_fans_have_the_shortest_memories/;It absolutely pains me to have witnessed how you all treated Ronaldo this last year. Man had 1 subpar season and you totally disregard the last 2 decades of pure quality that he gave the sport.You may have forgotten but here in Africa (and I'm sure Asia and Middle East as well), we still remember that he is one of the greatest players to every kick a football. You're so spoiled having these greats in your backyard that you so easily disregard them. And the audacity to feel betrayed when he decides to follow the money instead of jumping through hoops to please you as he's met with nothing but disrespect.I'm happy for Saudi Arabian fans who get to witness first hand the final days of a wonderful career and I'm happy for Ronaldo who can once again play in front of cheering fans and media that actually want to see him succeed.Can't wait to see who you'll betray next? If you can even turn your backs on a 5 time Ballon d'Or winner, is anyone safe?
Reddit;Ronaldo move to Saudi Arabia is the medias fault.;Marktheshark455;2022/12/31;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zzsrd7/ronaldo_move_to_saudi_arabia_is_the_medias_fault/;This might be a little rant, but just bare with me. Why are people so shocked that Ronaldo took the Cash bag and went Saudi Arabia. Has anyone been paying attention to how the media has attacked this man this past year? Do I agree with everything Ronaldo has done these past couple months, no. But we are talking about one of , if not the greatest players to ever live, and the respect shown to this man has been a complete joke. Does anyone here actually believe that a player who scored a hattrick earlier this year against spurs is finished. His son died, anyone who experienced that before knows it’s not easy to recover from. The club he gave his everything for didn’t believe him when his own daughter was sick. The media started this narrative that he was finished and a problem for Manchester United when he was banging hattricks. Top scorer on the team, and they took advantage of it when he lost his son. I don’t think Ronaldo wanted to go Saudi Arabia, but believe me if he went Chelsea or Bayern, the media will continue attacking him saying he shouldn’t start. Ronaldo probably just wanted peace and decided to give everyone the middle finger and dip , I don’t blame him. We don’t deserve him. I don’t care if you’re a Messi fan , anyone who doesn’t see the brilliance of this man and what he gave to the sport , should stop watching soccer. Ronaldo is the most hated athlete because he’s the most successful and I have so much respect for him how he was able to deal with media ,fifa all these years against him. Michael Jordan said if he played today he wouldn’t survive playing because of the media for his mental health. Imagine Ronaldo.

In watching [this](https://twitter.com/tancredipalmeri/status/1608615839183556608?t=14WgDTBPMA_0cQmm8XyDZw&s=08), i see: Zidane meets Ronaldinho, meets Messi, without exaggeration. Fitness levels and sports medicine aside, footy is the *only* major sport that i can think of that you could take a **boss** from several decades ago, throw him into the arena, and they'd still dominate against modern professionals. There's something to be said about that, i think.Respect to this cat for that.   Fucking Legend. RIP.

Now if you want to give Messi the next Ballon D'or for his WC triumph, well then it will be a little bit weird to give an award for the best player in 2023 for achievements made in 2022. When the 2023 voting would take place, the memory of WC will be already a bit faded. So this situation is a bit strange. Nobody thinks about Benzema right now, and yet he is the best player in 2022 according to the Ballon D'or. So Messi performance in the WC is too late for BD22 and too early for BD23, what a shame.

I just try to put neutral opinions. no emotional thinking which most football fans suffer from. &#x200B;1-Zidane: heavily inconsistent. great player and balondor worthy no doubt. but people dont realize how inconsistent he was. if any one wanna see the best version fo him watch euro 2000. 2-Ibrahimo: he is heavily overrated. yes he score goals but most of them are taps ins and due to his postioning and getting feeded from midfield. there are other skills outside scoring such as intelligent movement, passing, pressing, creativity and he was lacking it all esp the movement. he is a motherfucker lazy. I know my insult may trigger his fans but idc. I dont idiolize.3-cristiano ronaldo: He is exceptional only at three things: postional awareness, explosivity and shooting. other things he is above medicore regard it but not exceptional4-Ronaldinho: listen i dont know any more overrated than him. his dribblings were slowing the game. his tactics was slowing the game. he is just a showboat. and I watched many of his matches. this opinion may trigger some but I swear by god its my truth.5-R9: nah im kiddingand thats is. please no insults. be civil. it is not worthy to have anger regarding millionares who dont know even our existance."

Reddit;Why is nobody talking about the team Messi won the World Cup with?;NoahCGC;2022/12/30;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zyyjr6/why_is_nobody_talking_about_the_team_messi_won/;One of Messi's biggest criticisms throughout his career is how he's always played in the best teams with the best players.I'm sure we've all heard how he can't win without Xavi and Iniesta, and with Argentina how he's had world class forwards in Aguero, Di Maria, Tevez etc. Therefore, I am surprised as to why nobody has mentioned the fact that Messi won the World Cup with a side that contained literally nobody compared to the level of players he's been criticized for having the luxury of playing with his entire career.Personnel wise, this was Argentina's worst squad in a very long time, not performance wise obviously, a majority of them played at the top of their game which is largely to do with Messi being able to elevate the players around him to a new level, however if we go through the core players 1 by 1, we'll begin to see the lack of world beaters there are.Emi Martinez - Bench warmer at Arsenal for a decade and currently plays for Aston Villa. Arguably their 2nd best player of the tournament.  Acuna/Tagliafico/Molina/Montiel - Ask any average football fan, they would know next to nothing about any of Argentina's full-backs.  Otamendi - Became known for being one of the most error prone defenders in the world.  Romero - Nobody knew him before joining Spurs. Even now people would struggle to say much about him.  Enzo - Plays for Benfica. Unless you have an eye for young talent, absolutely nobody knew who he was before this World Cup, arguably their 2nd best player of the tournament.  De Paul - Was playing for Udinese just last year. Is one of the better known players mainly because he's known for basically being Messi's bodyguard.  Mac Allister - Literally plays for Brighton.  Lautaro Martinez - Had a worse World Cup than Higuain 2014. At least Higuain scored the winner in the quarters, Lautaro missed at least 5 sitters throughout the campaign.  Alvarez - Doesn't even start for his club. Perfect example of a player getting elevated to a world class level during the tournament largely courtesy of Messi.  Di Maria - 2nd best player in the side based on ability and he recently got binned off to Juventus at 34 years old.It is tough to emphasize this point without discrediting the fantastic contribitions made by all the players, but where are the Xavi's, Iniesta's, Neymar's, and Suarez's in this list? Messi won the World Cup with a squad that most people wouldn't really bat an eye about. Something that should really be given more praise and attention.
Reddit;Why the MLS has to change if they want to be a top league with a top US national team.;salfordsoldier00;2022/12/28;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zxhryl/why_the_mls_has_to_change_if_they_want_to_be_a/;The thing about the MLS is its not competitive enough. Almost no self respecting footballer will go to the MLS unless it’s for one last payday at the end of their career. It has potential, but things have to change ESPECIALLY the way you don’t have relegation and promotion. It’s been a major part of the sport since the 1800s which makes it exciting to watch. Nobody wants to watch bottom table MLS teams towards the end of the season, because what’s the point. The players aren’t even trying to win because they have nothing to lose or gain, they already can’t win the league but they know they’re not going down so they just pass the ball around slowly for 90 minutes. Honestly I would hate to play the same teams, every season , year in year out, it’d be so boring. Also the fact that to win the MLS you have to win the playoffs. There is no other league that does this. What’s the point in finishing first in the league, if you still might not win it? It’s absolutely ridiculous. Also, there is no incentive for teams 2-7th place to want to finish higher, either way they will be in the playoffs and have a chance at winning the MLS. It makes games much less competitive. They should merge the Eastern/Western conferences into a single league with normal rules for winners, no playoffs. I know playoffs are “just how you do sports” in the US but if you want your teams and national team to be competitive internationally , then it’s what you have to do. Another thing is the way you “draft” players from college (university) teams, rather than utilising your underfunded and hardly used youth systems. It’s a very strange concept to us, because the rest of the world do not find our athletes this way. Also, it might make it more difficult for the USMNT to develop good players, because the only ones who really get a chance to play professionally are the ones who went to college. Almost every English footballer didn’t go to university, a lot barely even went to school, because they were playing football instead. It just feels like the MLS are using football as a money making revenue machine, rather than as a sport. Which makes sense of their refusal to allow relegation and promotion like every other league. Why do you think Beckham started an MLS team and not any other league? It’s not because he thinks it’s an exciting league, he’s after money. Not just because he was offered it when he signed for Galaxy, but because he knows it’s a safe business investment. He can’t lose, which is good business but it takes all the fun out of football. The MLS will never be popular outside the US, Canada and Mexico until they realise that.

But what I want to know is if clubs need to be able to fund the add ons when signing a player? For example, let’s say a player costs a club £40 Million and £15 million in add ons and the the club only had available £40 million, would they still be able to complete the deal even though they don’t have the add on funds available at the time (even though it won’t be given unless player reaches targets set) , or does it just go off the main fee of £40 million. Idk if that makes sense hopefully it does.

Reddit;Who had the better World Cup campaign?

Goal contributions, dribbling ability, passing quality, clutch match winning moments, leadership etc. I grew up with Messi and as such have an inherent bias towards him, and these are some of the reasons I think he had a better campaign. (I recognize the bias though and would like to know your opinion too)-Was directly involved in the opening goal in 6 out of 7 matches. -Won 5 MOTM awards. Technically 6, but gave away the one against Poland to Mac Allister because he thought he deserved it.-Saved Argentina with his amazing goal against Mexico and provided two of the most beautiful assists in the tournament against Netherlands and Croatia. -Had an untouchable second half vs Australia and was unreal against Netherlands. Prime 2012 Messi vibes when he, even while constantly surrounded by 3 orange players, absolutely toyed with them and only lost the ball once (!!) during the entire game.-Although not *directly* involved, he was at least involved in the immediate buildup of *all* 8 goals scored in the QF, SF and final. -Put Argentina ahead of France twice in the final.-Confidently scored both shootout penalties, against Netherlands and France, to set the mood for the rest of the team. His leadership off the field was amazing too. Have you ever seen THAT many players in a team say they would 'die' for their captain on the field?I absolutely recognize the greatness of Maradona's 1986 campaign though. In terms of legend and mythology, Messi will likely never surpass what El Diego did. But only looking at the actual performances, was he still better (or more inportant) than Messi?

We also saw what having that freakish quickness did to guys like Hazard, Bale, Owen and Kaka.Now I will say this Mbappe is an era where medicine is far far more advanced and he’s not very injury prone overall… and I will also adda he seems a lot lighter than those other guys I mentioned. He naturally has a scrawny build which could reduce the stress on his knees but… I wonder if he is aware himself.

Reddit;The World Cup makes players from every league relevant;Dresdenlive;2022/12/26;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zvv93q/the_world_cup_makes_players_from_every_league/;One thing I loved about watching the World Cup is that it makes players from any league in the world relevant. While the best *teams* in the world play in the Top 5 European leagues, international football shows that players from all over the world can compete with them, and even win when the stakes are so much higher. For example: Benfica players were completely negating Lewandowski (who, in club football, usually dominates because plays on teams that are much richer than his opponents’ clubs). Other (of many) examples: • J-League players (or ones who just recently left Japan) were outplaying La Liga stars, and even stars from the Premier League.• It was surreal seeing Kye Rowles (from Heart of Midlothian in Scotland) play Lio Messi head on in a massive World Cup knockout match, and do it well!• I loved seeing players like Zimmerman (from the MLS) lead USA’s defensive line. I just love how international football makes every league on earth relevant by levelling the playing field in a way that just isn’t possible in a $$$ based “rich eat poor” club system.

Is the debate over? IMO it can reopen if Portugal wins the 2026 worldcup.

Reddit;The REQUIREMENT to win the World Cup in order to be the GOAT is elitist gatekeeping;dangerousman8;2022/12/26;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zvlddf/the_requirement_to_win_the_world_cup_in_order_to/;"Now that Messi has finally won the WC everyone has become more comfortable to title him as the GOAT.But in fact I don't think that the WC changes much about how good he was/is. Most Golden balls, most golden booths, spain's all time goal/assist scorer and most likely the all time champions league scorer/assister given he plays for 2 more years.But there was always the low IQ argument ""bUt mUh nO wOrLd cUp"" argument. Basically if you are not born, or gain pasport of 8 out of 195 countries, you CAN NEVER become the GOAT.No matter how good you are. Also only 80 countries have played in the WC. So if you are born in one of the 115 other,  you will not even get to play in the WC.Case and point Earing Haaland. He can break all the records. Score 2000 goals. Win 10 champions leagues. Win the golden boot 15 times. But because he is norwegian by blood and heart and decided to represent them, instead of his birth country of England, he can never become the GOAT, cuz ""mUh nO wOrLd cUp"".On the other hand winning a WC gives you a 1000% boost.   Look at the brazilian Ronaldo, who in 15 years playing in europe never won champions league, had only 2 domestic titles and won the golden shoe once. But because he was great at the 2002 WC people put him on the same level with players who have been the best at their clubs and in the world, for decades.Or Pele and Maradona for that matter. Nobody would be putting them in the conversation if they havent won the WC. That why a player who was better than both of them Johan Cruyff never gets into the GOAT conversation. BUT if Argentina hadn't bought the 1978 WC everybody would be like Cruyff  da goat, 10 domestic titles, 3 champions leagues in a row, 3 ballon d'or winner, FIFA World Cup Golden Ball and mUh  1978 wOrLd cUp wiNnEr."

We don't know who will qualify or what the nations will look like in 3 1/2 years from now but for me, as it stands, I see France, Spain, Morocco, and the U.S. reaching the semis. And ending with a France v Spain final. France continuously looks so good, will have an even better Mbappe, and will be a huge achievement to reach the final back-to-back-to-back at the world cup. Spain still seems like a team in transition right now, but will be a strong force by then with this new up-and-coming generation they are producing, and who knows, maybe even be led by Pep by then? Morocco surprised the world this world cup and I see them repeating this feat since their group is relatively youngish and their players will improve more by then. Finally, this might be my patriotism talking but I feel the U.S. will finally show the world how good its golden generation is as most, if not all, will be in their prime and will be playing a lot of games at home (hoping to match their 1930 3rd place finish.)

I’d say he’s better than Henry at 23/24AT BEST I see no reason why he can’t be the greatest French Player ever as but I think he’ll probably need a Champions League and a couple  Ballon D’ors along with maybe another World Cup to reach that Zidane/Platini Tier. Which I’d say are all pretty are all goals that are within reach with the teams he has at Club Level and International level and the individual talent he has. He’s already on pace to SHATTER the French Goal scoring record. All he needs is longevity.In your opinion what do you guys think?

The only other ""illegal"" act that doesnt have a fk (that I can recall) is dissent and taking off your shirt, since there isn't really a spot on the field it occurred . Even unintentional fouls like offside or foul throw result in a turn over, and ""deterrent"" penalties for things like diving also include a fk.

Reddit;Mbappe is my next Messi for the next generation of great players;Messi_isGoat;2022/12/26;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zvbcz7/mbappe_is_my_next_messi_for_the_next_generation/;" Warning: Don't read part 1&2 (they're just mumbling- actually all of it)I like Mbappe. Not nearly as much (yet) but, the way I like Messi - Why I like him: I believe in his ""play style"", it's incredible to watch his high speed or shots. And I think it's RELIABLE to win him a lot individually and for his teams for year after year(just like Messi/Ronaldo), Neymar's play style could not even win him the ballon d'or, while Mbappe's definitely can/will. And just like M10/cr7, he's not prone to injury. So his future looks bright to me. I'll be rooting for him, France & PSG(messi, Barca & Arg will always be priority/favorite). I really hope if someone will SURPASS MESSI, it better be him. for someone to surpass Messi, they gotta do more than Cr7, then reach and surpass Messi. Doable considering he always got a WC (HE WON'T PROBABLY WIN 7 BALLON, MOST LIKELY MORE WORLD THO)Part 1: M10 vs CR7 style:Messi and Cr7 are good, but both have different natural way to score. Ronaldo like long shot, high Speed run, free kick, one dribble in the opponent square and shoot. While Messi may start midfield, dribble everyone to the goal, or tiki taka 1-2 1-2 until reach goalie. That's why I prefer Messi over Ronaldo: his play style is more fun to watch. I'd rather watch him dribble 5 players and score, than watch Ronaldo score long ass shot (impressive as well).And I personally think Messi's play style is more reliable than Ronaldo (probably bias) - let's say one of their team is in bad situation, I think Messi will most likely to deliver and get his team head using his play style than Ronaldo long shots.As they getting older, Ronaldo's long shots work less and less. While Messi can still somehow get himself out/aroudn 3-4 opponent with the ball (if that makes any sense). Messi's play style works better for collective, allow him to make pass decisive (and he never cares if his teammates end up scoring) . While Ronaldo's long shot doesn't( and I believe Ronaldo used to show attitude when Madrid teammate scores instead of him).I know what you thinking: Mpabbe is more like cr7, he don't dribble 4 or 5 players to score goals. It's just that I don't see anyone as the next ""Messi"" - so, for next gen of players, I'll support Mbappe.Part 2 : You're either Average good or you're Messi/CR7I have a feeling he's gonna make it to the top. Not like Neymar who had a lot of potential, and barely accomplish anything with it while years pass by. Not like any other number 9's who got into the spotlight for a couple of years but stay among the average good ones (Torres, Suarez, falcao, Giroud, forland, lewandowski, aguero, benzema•, cavani, morata, Alexi Sanchez, higuain, Van persi,...)these ARE GOOD, but not GOOD ENOUGH to shine like Messi/Ronaldo*""year after year""* [Mo Salah was seriously on the rise, But fell off] . But I believe Mbappe will be outstanding like Messi and Ronaldo Someone that can carry their team not just to victory, but to title(club and country). I believe Mbappe can carry PSG to UCL and France to WC champions(again) UNPOPULAR OPINION: HAALAND WILL STAY AVAREGE GOOD (nothing like Messi/Ronaldo, so he's no ""next anybody"", well maybe Next Zlatan. But Zlatan was also average good(maybe better, but never got UCL)."

I was shocked now slow everyone was ALL THE TIME.  The passes were also very slow, if they happened today 90$ of the passes would be intercepted. But they are not because of my next point.Pressing doesn't exist. When a team gets the ball they are [free to attack and get to about 25 meters from the opponents goal](https://youtu.be/GomTORLZcWw?t=3723) before anyone tries to take the ball away.Everyone is hyper individualistic. It's literally 1 guy that tries to dribble his way into the opposition and then shoot or pass. Combination pay doesn't exist. I watched like [8 different](https://youtu.be/GomTORLZcWw?t=2078) players [shoot 30 meters](https://youtu.be/GomTORLZcWw?t=1962) from [the goal](https://youtu.be/GomTORLZcWw?t=2122). [This](https://youtu.be/GomTORLZcWw?t=1671) is what the best free kicker in Brazil is doing in a world cup final. Literally half the shots in the game were these hopeless, talentless kicks that will make any modern coach bench a player on the spot. [And here is the most talentless of them all](https://youtu.be/GomTORLZcWw?t=3537).But the thing that brought me to thiers of laughter was the defending, or the complete there lack of.There is no team cohesion, everyone is doing their own thing with zero consideration of the players around him.There is no such thing as line of defense. You would have 1 dumb defender who just forgets to move and is 3 meters behind his teammates.There is no defensive support from the midfield. Once you get past them they will not run back to help the defenders but will sheepishly watch the attacker go 1v1 with the defender.I have no Idea how someone could claim that Pele(or Maradona) Is the best at football.Now If you want to say that he is the king of flupbol or some other made up thing, that's fine. But from my point of view what they played then and what they play now are two different games. Also in Brazil Pele used to play against people who have day jobs. Do you honestly think that the guys who play in the 12th team in the Paulista are raising families with the 20$ a month they were payed?People with low intelligence always seem to simp for the old days. The old masters are always going to be better no matter what type of thing, when the reality is that everything advancess all the time. Like 10 years ago Michael Phelps used to hold all the records in swimming, now he has 1 individual left.Edit:I see that every seccond comment is coulda, shoulda, woulda. Thinking that if Pele and Maradona had the same training as Messi and Ronaldo, they would be the Greatest.WRONG, there are a million talented players, who have modern training and who don't make it big, because of their mental lack of understanding of the complexities of the modern game. Just because you could do some tricks doesn't mean you will be a professional.Remember Robinho? Remember how talented he was? How he was the seccond comming of Pele? And how he bombed once he started playing in europe he bombed himself into oblivion.  Also to further trash Pele and Maradona  WHEN COMPARED WITH PEOPLE FROM THEIR TIME.   Pele was outperformed or outscored in every single world cup he has played 1958 Just Fontaine 13 goals | Pele 6 goals 1962 Six players tied for 4 goals | Pele 1 goal 1966 Eusébio 9 goals | Pele 1 goal 1970 Gerd Müller 10 goals | Pele 4 goals  Pele wasn't even the best player in MSL  [New York Cosmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Cosmos_(1970%E2%80%931985)). In his 3 seasons he never became the top scorer of the league.  Dont get me started with Maradona. He was never the top scorer in europe despite playing there for 10 years. He was only 2 times top scorer in HIS OWN TEAMS in europe. He never won an  Champions league (Messi 4). He was really the top assist provider in his own team (2 out of 10). Compare that with Messi who has been both the top scorer and assist provider for his teams for majority of the last 15 years. Winning 6 european golden shoes, Maradona - 0.  Messi 8 domestic golden shoes, Maradona - 0.

And 3 years since I played competitively in a league or Highschool. I played Highschool was a starting left wing/striker im 6’2 about 170 pounds. The question is can I return to the same form I was In when I was 18 or 19 in my prime? The biggest thing I noticed was gone was my fast pace and my stamina.. I did gain some weight and muscle in the past years and I was missing that when I played before. Can I return to the same pace and dribbling control I had before ? Or do I have to change my playstyle now? I would love to still be able to beat defenders on the wing and chase through balls like I used to. Any advice and tips help.

This generation is so woke man honestly, should Teves have given up his medal when he held up Rip Fergie no, it was painful as a United fan of course it was but it’s passion that we love in the game most of the time. It can go too far in both of these cases. He should be fined World Cup winnings and that’s about it. As well as a public apology to  young man, but for Unai to say he should give up his World Cup medal is ridiculous. Shithousery is part of the game but what rule did he break. A proper apology to Mbappe when he is back to normal after partying for a week in Argentina is the simple solution. He won Argentina the World Cup which is huge in South America especially after their barren spell. Yes what he did was wrong but he did nothing wrong on the pitch,and that’s all that matters. This type of football is the best to watch and as long as it’s not a brutal tackle like we saw on the Leicester young player, the worst he should get is a fine and a heartfelt apology.What are peoples thoughts?

Reddit;VAR Usage in the World Cup - A better way;Excellent-Virus-8882;2022/12/24;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zu3czz/var_usage_in_the_world_cup_a_better_way/;Amidst the drama of the Qatar World Cup including one of the best finals of all time, the human rights and corruption issues associated with the host nation and the beer ban, there is an endless list of things to reflect on. One topic which may lose the competition for attention in the wake of the World Cup is the use of VAR, and whether it has enhanced the world game. As it standsThe problem that seems to be addressed by VAR’s current iteration is injustice around the penalty box stemming from three main sources: 1) the offside rule 2) the handball rule and 3) fouls which are missed by the referee in real time. In this area, VAR adds an added layer of precision in terms of offside, with minor technical infringements of the rule being flagged. It also catches serious fouls that the referee may have missed. So what can be said for VAR is that it removes some level of arbitrariness from football. However in many ways football is a sea of randomness, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It has deflections, referee errors in the build up to a goal which are judged too remote to review, and we’ve all made what seems to be an error on the field that turns out to be in our team’s favour. One of the appeals of soccer is that it’s low scoring system makes upsets (which often have an element of luck) more frequent than other sports. So it’s not clear that reducing randomness around the penalty box makes the game a better sport for spectators. The benefit of introducing VAR, then, is uncertain. Reasonable people may disagree as to whether reducing the element of fortune in the game is a boon at all. The disadvantage, however, is clear. The technology slows down games and can lead to some fantastic goals being overturned due to having a fingernail ahead of the defender. This encourages attackers to ensure that they give defenders an extra half yard of space, and this bias will likely lead to less goals and more defensive football. While the current VAR technology is remarkable, it has a clear downside, and it’s not clear that the problems that it solves were problems in the first place.VAR as it could be While the popularity of the world game speaks for itself, there are issues with the game that have held it back, particular in “soccer” countries where football competes with the oval ball games. The low scoring nature of the game is one challenge which VAR does not seem capable of solving. However the other main problem in these regions is the pervasiveness of simulation as a means of attractive a referee’s attention. This  is certainly something that VAR could address, without interrupting the flow of the game. My proposed interim solution is to simply allow the VAR to review tackles, and hand out yellow cards when it is beyond reasonable doubt that a player has attempted to deceive a referee. As a starting point, it will be important to utilise the ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ threshold to ensure that players who have potentially been impeded do not receive a yellow card for attempting to draw a referee’s attention to that fact. However if a player is aware that the VAR will be assessing their behaviour, that behaviour is likely to change, and in quick fashion after their first yellow.The yellow card could be given at the next break in play, so there would be no interruption to the flow of play, and no consequences from the VAR intervention for the match beyond the giving of the yellow card (i.e. no free kick for the opposing team). The advantage of this approach is that by adopting a high standard of proof, there’s no real down side to experimenting with this. In my view, if FIFA view the offside rule as sufficiently serious to justify such strict adherence that putting a toe out of line is enough to disallow a goal, then it’s difficult to see why simulation should not also be policed. The A-league would be an ideal practice ground to test this application of the VAR, as fans have a very hostile reaction to simulation, and the move would undoubtably be well received by local press and fansWould be grateful for your thoughts on how VAR could be used to improve the game beyond it’s current iteration

I loved every game; there were so many surprises and unexpected outcomes. Anyway, now that it is over, I want to continue watching football, so I am currently watching the Carabao cup since yesterday. Great game between Liverpool and man city! I am concerned about sharing / discussing football with others regarding competitions outside the world cup. People are very opinionated about football, what team they support, players they like, transfers,  manager strategy, etc. I don't have this depth of knowledge and feel embarrassed about it somehow, but I enjoy watching. I'm 36 years old, by the way! 😂 I don't support a team yet; I don't feel I have enough ‘experience’ to decide which team to support, so that's also confusing to me. It feels strange to say I support Liverpool or Man U just because my friends do.. or maybe I should? Just have a common bond, perhaps. Any advice for a newbie like me? Like what are 'core' things I should know. Perhaps where I can do more research and get up to speed so I can be a 'proper man' 🤣If anyone has watched the IT crowd, I remind myself of 'Roy & Moss Pretend To like Football' especially when one of the guys asks 'so what team do you support?' Roy looks at Ham and decides West Ham 🤣"

I have a background in football when i was 11 to 16 years old. I used to be a goalie when i was 11 up to when i was 13 and switch roles to be a left midfielder. Coaches and teammates used to think i have what it takes to join pursue professional football but it all turned around when my luck ran out. now that I’m 22, i realized the what ifs of my life and career if i didn’t stop dreaming of stepping into the big leagues. You see, in my country, football wasn’t exactly the main sport and it’s usually basketball that gets all the attention and the funds from our government and the populous as a whole.So by that, things took a turn when i reached 17. I lost the spark i had once from seeing people not even batting an eye on the sport. There were few reasons actually. One is i had a very major injury resulting in breaking my arm and being told to not ever play the sport as i cause casualty on the field and on the team. That took my soul out of my body because all i ever wanted was to prove that i am a capable player who will do any training hard-work and dedication there is on football. Sadly, it was all but fantasy to me. Two is seeing the potential it has on the country which is very small. I figured that if i traveled abroad I’d have the opportunity i assume i can get. But thats when i lose the ambition, Adulting. Getting to this stage can be very dull and disappointing because you realize a lot back then when its already too late. But for some reason deep inside of me i still wanna go back to my roots and pursue even though i’d be really impossible to even be noticed by clubs as i had never touched a football after senior high 😂. I am planning to train again just to try and see if i still got that inner footballer and awaken what was once sleeping. I still want to dream but is it too late?

Argentina’s captain converted the penalty to give Argentina the lead. Next, his deft touch was key in springing the move which led to *La Albiceleste’s* second.Then in the closing stages of normal time, Mbappé single-handedly took a grip of the game, scoring two goals in two minutes and sending the final to extra time.Messi looked shot and Mbappé looked like he was just getting going.Except it was the diminutive Argentine who next popped up to score his second goal of the match and restore his team’s lead in the 109th minute.Refusing to accept defeat, Mbappé roused his teammates, scoring a second penalty to grab his hat-trick and take the final to a penalty shootout.Both Mbappé and Messi scored in the shootout but in the end – with France missing two penalties – it was the Argentina captain who was mobbed by his teammates as his World Cup dream was lived out in real time.Over two hours of soccer, these was two players – at two different points of their careers – demonstrating the beautiful game in vivid, glorious technicolor.## [messi vs mbappe](https://preview.redd.it/zksvux7bkd7a1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6858336984c16f94523d56f8834a9930f840ea78)## From the spotThe last time a World Cup final went to penalties was in 2006 when France was once again beaten, this time by Italy.Sometimes, it feels unfair to settle a game in a shootout, a series of actions between the penalty taker and the goalkeeper. However, at the Lusail Stadium on Sunday, the abundance of penalties seemed to ratchet up the pressure and tension.Messi’s penalty in the first half gave him his first World Cup final goal, while his spot kick in the shootout was coolness personified.Mbappé’s ability to not once, not twice, but three times successfully convert from the spot in one game showed extreme gumptionPreviously at Qatar 2022, one team had already experienced the intensity of that pressure cooker atmosphere and emerged the other side, and one which had not.Argentina got the better of the Netherlands in the quarterfinals in an epic which culminated in a penalty shootout, and one which saw the South American team display distraction and delaying tactics to arguably mentally monster their opponents.In Sunday’s final, Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez showing his ability to distract the French takers, throwing the ball away before Aurélien Tchouaméni attempt, which flew wide. France’s previous attempt – from Kingsley Coman – had been saved by Martinez.A penalty shootout is arguably unlike anything else in sports – it’s a modern day duel and a World Cup final with so much at stake only heightens the tension and drama.&#x200B;[martinez](https://preview.redd.it/0spnzmo6pd7a1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d4f7b5623d618adfd39dcb358dd93f706721e64)## Great goalsWorld Cup finals are often tight and cagey affairs, with goals at a premium.Argentina and France threw away that playbook – delivering six goals, two of which were of the highest quality.Argentina’s second was arguably as good as Carlos Alberto’s breathtaking goal in the 1970 World Cup final in Brazil’s 4-1 win over Italy.It was in the 35th minute, when a flick round the corner from Alexis Mac Allister to Messi, relieved some pressure on the Argentina defense as France pushed for an equalizer.After Messi’s deft touch to Julián Álvarez and the Manchester City forward’s excellently weighted pass to Mac Allister, who had continued his run, Argentina was in on goal.Unselfishly, Mac Allister had the presence of mind to square the ball to Ángel Di María who finished off a brilliant sweeping counterattack to put Argentina 2-0 upAt that point, it looked to be the crowning moment of a dominant Argentina victory, until Mbappé stepped up.After his penalty reduced the deficit to 2-1, a neat one-two with Marcus Thuram had the ball falling to the PSG star out of the sky on the edge of Argentina’s penalty area.With seemingly all the time in the world, Mbappé produced a wonderful display of technique and timing to thunder the ball past a despairing Martínez.These are the moments that capture imaginations and the moments that came to define the 2022 World Cup final.It will be remembered for so many reasons – Messi’s moment of history, Mbappé’s hat-trick in defeat, the seesaw nature of the game that oscillated from end to end and never ceased to tug on gobsmacked watchers’ emotions.Overall with its multiples story lines and the drama and artistry on display, surely the 2022 showpiece now owns the title of ‘greatest World Cup final.’&#x200B;[mbappe](https://preview.redd.it/vbpk3iq0qd7a1.jpg?width=690&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1f637e55427dfaf4438136268210c06dcb9f9ec)"

Reddit;Trying to understand Dibu's mentality;soundingdemo;2022/12/21;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zs0jf0/trying_to_understand_dibus_mentality/;There are some players who are slightly odd acting like Balotelli or Gazza. They do funny things and may lack discipline but they are also talented. I thought Dibu might fall into their category.

Reddit;There's a difference between the best footballer of all time, and the greatest of all time.;Bakahashi;2022/12/22;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zse2md/theres_a_difference_between_the_best_footballer/;Lionel Messi is the best ever to play the game. Full stop. Nobody's skills match up. Of course, it's because the game has evolved, technology, everything has evolved. Obviously, in due time there may be better players than him as well. It seems unlikely because I think he tapped into greatness very early. So, although it's possible that you'll have 30 year olds better than Messi or Ronaldo at 30, in future, but to see a 16 year old with that magic touch, very unlikely. Now, about greatness. That's a combination of quite a few things, really. Your impact on the game, on the sport. Influence on pop culture, etc. many things. I think Pele, Maradona and Messi, all are in that debate now. And that we can discuss. There we may have our subjective opinions. But as far the best footballer to have ever worn a pair of boots is concerned, Messi is the man, hands down.

Reddit;Reason for ronaldo hate?(serious);Ballsballs37;2022/12/22;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zsly7p/reason_for_ronaldo_hateserious/;"I'm confused as to why cristiano ronaldo has been hated by so many...""people""...throughout his career. I've always been neutral on the topic,not really caring about him myself, but it is really weird. A common answer would be a rapist, but this is untrue, and an example of people lying to themselves. They hated cr7 before the rape case and use it to tell themselves their hate for him comes from their good morals. So what causes an adult to let another man live in their heads rent free? What can cause someone to continually emberass themselves and sink lower and lower like this? I think the answer is an inferiority complex. People who haven't done much or are unsatisfied with their lives often look at someone who has done much with a great amount of envy. So when it comes to the messi/cr7 debate, people naturally gravitate to the one who looks like they escaped from the set of the hobbit, rather than the one who isn't shy about the gap between them and the rest of humanity. It no surprise a lot of the hate comes from the u.k, a oddly miserable nation with an bewildering inferiority complex.The ones who look at the cr7 decline with glee bring to mind a pack of hyenas surrounding a lion who is dying of old age. ""Yes, I've done nothing with my life and am deeply unhappy, but at least messi is better than ronaldo""."

Wow! What an amazing World Cup that was. I never really cared for football prior to the cup besides the casual games my buddy’s and I would play after school back in primary and secondary school, but I’m hooked and want more, but I do have some questions.Based on my small understanding of how FIFA is organized, there are “Leagues” all over the world and within those leagues there are “Clubs”. Being from Canada we are a part of the MLS with the USA correct?Now I’m pretty sure not all leagues are created equal and the leagues that most people pay attention to are England’s Premier League, France’s Ligue 1, Spain’s Laliga Santander and Germany’s Bundesliga right?Now when it comes to watching games, with a DAZN subscription would I be able to watch any league I want? Is there another subscription that’s better quality and price wise you would recommend instead of DAZN?Thank you in advance for helping me out. As a person who use to call the sport soccer and now feels more comfortable calling it football this means a lot.

That 11 British blokes could defeat a modern football club, because they tackled harder and the ball was heavier(?)I'm not crazy right, on athleticism alone after 90 minutes, Wolves would win comfortably.Right?
Reddit;Luis Suarez is the greatest striker to grace the prem;Unlikely-Fish237;2022/12/21;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zrpi48/luis_suarez_is_the_greatest_striker_to_grace_the/;43g/a in 33 games? In 13/14 season Without taking a single penalty it’s definitely the best individual season in pl history him being the greatest pl striker is debatable but who else could have matched or succeed those stats? In that Liverpool side? The same side that almost won the league title because of Suarez’s influence try and change my mind? He could link up play, dribble, and pass just as well Henry and in terms of the ‘eye test’ Suarez is king the only argument that is valid is longevity but I have no doubt he would have still been world class if he didn’t move to Barca it would be interesting to see how he would preform in Liverpool’s current squad

Some memoriable misses come to my mind every time he is about to take a PK (such as Chelsea in UCL, some in Copa America, against Real Madrid in UCL as a PSG player last year etc.) but it looks like he overcomed that ""fault"" that he had with penalties during this World Cup, he scored them so easily every time apart from Poland one but still great"

Reddit;Who has the most trophies in football history: Messi or Daniel Alves?;AntPRodP;2022/12/20;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zqm0if/who_has_the_most_trophies_in_football_history/;"When we decide to make and share ranking lists (such as, for example, one with the players with the most titles/trophies), it is very difficult for them to be consensual; they are very likely to generate debate/discussion. If FIFA were to publish an official list, the conversation would certainly be different (since, as the highest football entity, a list published by FIFA would have to be considered as the most reliable) but, in the absence of such a list, it is normal that different lists emerge.However, there are 2 aspects that must undoubtedly be taken into account when making a ranking:A) *We must explain the criteria used* (sharing a ranking list without explaining how we arrived at it is not valid).B) *There must be coherence in the construction and application of these criteria* (for example, if we count the Olympic Games for player A, we also have to count the Olympic Games for player B, obviously).But, in this particular case of the number of trophies, where can there be disparities in the construction of criteria?**1) Do only senior competitions count or do lower-level competitions also count?** Are competitions above U-19 all automatically senior? It is normal that this generates different opinions, especially the second question. It is legitimate to consider the under-20 World Cups, under-21 European Championships or the Olympic Games (under-23), despite the fact that they are not competitions played by the A National Teams.**2) Which competitions are considered official?** This one is relatively easier: just follow what FIFA says. For example, Daniel Alves has Catalan Cups and Super Cups on his resume, but FIFA does not recognize them as official.**3) Do only top-tier competitions count or should we consider trophies from lower divisions and reserve teams?** On this point, too, it is legitimate to have differences of opinion. If, for example, FIFA considers the English or Italian second division as official, why shouldn't we count them if they are part of a player's resume? But, on the other hand, is it correct to put side by side secondary/reserve cups and competitions such as a World Cup or a Champions League? There will certainly be different opinions.**4) Finally, what does a player have to do so we consider he won a certain trophy?** Does he have to play in that competition (even 1 minute)? Is it enough to have been on the game sheet at least once? Is it enough to be registered, without ever having been on the bench? Or is it enough to be part of the senior squad, regardless of whether you are registered for the competition or not (here we have the examples of players with long-term injuries)? But what does it mean to “be part of the senior squad”? Does the player have to have been introduced to the fans in the beggining of the season? Does he have to play at least 1 official game during the season in question? As we can see, it's not simple.Taking all this into account, let's analyze the cases of the 2 players with the most trophies in the history of football, regardless of the criteria used (unless there are players in Indonesia, or Taiwan, or even Burkina Faso, who have won more competitions, but don't have the attention of the media and official entities): Messi and Daniel Alves.***Messi's official senior top-tier trophies:***\--> *Trophies that don't raise any doubts:* **39** (4 Champions League; 10 Spanish Leagues; 1 French League; 7 Spanish Cups; 7 Spanish Super Cups; 1 French Super Cup; 3 European Super Cups; 3 Club World Cups; 1 World Cup; 1 Copa America; 1 Finalíssima).\--> *Trophies that must be counted if we consider competitions that, despite not being played by the National A Teams, have the participation of senior players*: **2** (1 U-20 World Cup; 1 Olympic Games).\--> *Trophies that must be counted if we consider competitions in which the player, despite being part of the squad, did not play any minute:* **1** (1 Spanish Super Cup).Therefore, in the case of Lionel Messi, we can see that, according to the criteria I have explained, the total number of top-tier official senior trophies is **39, 41 or 42**.***Daniel Alves top-tier official senior trophies:***\--> *Trophies that don't raise any doubts:* **41** (3 Champions League; 2 Europa League; 1 Brazilian Copa do Nordeste; 1 Brazilian Campeonato Paulista; 6 Spanish Leagues; 1 Italian League; 2 French Leagues; 1 Italian Cup; 1 French Cup; 1 French League Cup; 5 Spanish Super Cups; 1 French Super Cup; 5 Spanish Cups; 4 European Super Cups; 3 Club World Cups; 2 Copa America; 2 Confederations Cups)\--> *Trophies that must be counted if we consider competitions that, despite not being played by the National A Teams, have the participation of senior players*: **2** (1 U-20 World Cup; 1 Olympic Games).\--> *Trophies that must be counted if we consider competitions in which the player, despite being part of the squad, did not play any minute:* **3** (1 French Super Cup; 1 Brazilian Campeonato Baiano; 1 Brazilian Copa do Nordeste).Therefore, in the case of Daniel Alves, we can see that, according to the criteria I have explained, the total number of official senior top-tier trophies is **41, 43 or 46**.**CONCLUSION:** Daniel Alves is still number 1 in this matter. But probably not for long."

The recent detection of warm H$_2$O vapor emission from the outflowsof carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars challenges the currentunderstanding of circumstellar chemistry. Two mechanisms have been invoked toexplain warm H$_2$O vapor formation. In the first, periodic shocks passingthrough the medium immediately above the stellar surface lead to H$_2$Oformation. In the second, penetration of ultraviolet interstellar radiationthrough a clumpy circumstellar medium leads to the formation of H$_2$Omolecules in the intermediate wind.  Aims. We aim to determine the properties of H$_2$O emission for a sample of18 carbon-rich AGB stars and subsequently constrain which of the abovemechanisms provides the most likely warm H$_2$O formation pathway.

Zanin;2014/09/22;http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.6073v2;The MAGIC telescopes are two Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs)located on the Canary island of La Palma. The telescopes are designed tomeasure Cherenkov light from air showers initiated by gamma rays in the energyregime from around 50 GeV to more than 50 TeV. The two telescopes were built in2004 and 2009, respectively, with different cameras, triggers and readoutsystems. In the years 2011-2012 the MAGIC collaboration undertook a majorupgrade to make the stereoscopic system uniform, improving its overallperformance and easing its maintenance. In particular, the camera, thereceivers and the trigger of the first telescope were replaced and the readoutof the two telescopes was upgraded. This paper (Part I) describes the detailsof the upgrade as well as the basic performance parameters of MAGIC such as rawdata treatment, dead time of the system, linearity in the electronic chain andsources of noise. In Part II, we describe the physics performance of theupgraded system.

The results provide direct evidence forphonon-assisted charge density wave order in Na$_2$Ti$_{2}Pn_{2}$O and identifya proximate ordered phase that could compete with superconductivity in dopedBaTi$_{2}$Sb$_{2}$O.

ArXiv;First Observation of $D^+\to ημ^+ν_μ$ and Measurement of its  Decay Dynamics;BESIII Collaboration;2020/03/27;http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12220v2;By analyzing a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of$2.93~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ collected at a center-of-mass energy of 3.773 GeV withthe BESIII detector, we measure for the first time the absolute branchingfraction of the $D^+\to \eta \mu^+\nu_\mu$ decay to be ${\mathcal B}_{D^+\to\eta \mu^+\nu_\mu}=(10.4\pm1.0_{\rm stat}\pm0.5_{\rm syst})\times 10^{-4}$.Using the world averaged value of ${\mathcal B}_{D^+\to \eta e^+\nu_e}$, theratio of the two branching fractions is determined to be ${\mathcal B}_{D^+\to\eta \mu^+\nu_\mu}/{\mathcal B}_{D^+\to \eta e^+\nu_e}=0.91\pm0.13$, whichagrees with the theoretical expectation of lepton flavor universality withinuncertainty. Here, the uncertainty is the sum in quadrature of the statisticaland systematic uncertainties. By studying the differential decay rates in fivefour-momentum transfer intervals, we obtain the product of the hadronic formfactor $f^{\eta}_{+}(0)$ and the $c\to d$ Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrixelement $|V_{cd}|$ to be $f_{+}^\eta (0)|V_{cd}|=0.087\pm0.008_{\rmstat}\pm0.002_{\rm syst}$. Taking the input of $|V_{cd}|$ from the global fitin the standard model, we determine $f_{+}^\eta (0)=0.39\pm0.04_{\rmstat}\pm0.01_{\rm syst}$. On the other hand, using the value of $f_+^{\eta}(0)$calculated in theory, we find $|V_{cd}|=0.242\pm0.022_{\rm stat}\pm0.006_{\rmsyst}\pm0.033_{\rm theory}$.

Among these decays, the $D^0\to K^-\pi^+\eta$ and$D^+\to K^0_S\pi^+\eta$ decays have the largest branching fractions, which are$\mathcal{B} (D^0\to K^-\pi^+\eta )=(1.853\pm0.025_{\rm stat}\pm0.031_{\rmsyst})\%$ and $\mathcal{B}(D^+\to K^0_S\pi^+\eta)=(1.309\pm0.037_{\rmstat}\pm0.031_{\rm syst})\%$, respectively.

Its ratio with the world average value of the branching fraction ofthe $D^+\to \omega e^+\nu_e$ decay probes lepton flavor universality and it isdetermined to be ${\mathcal B}_{D^+\to \omega \mu^+\nu_\mu}/{\mathcal B}^{\rmPDG}_{D^+\to \omega e^+\nu_e}=1.05\pm0.14$, in agreement with the standardmodel expectation within one standard deviation.

ArXiv;Observation of the Doubly Cabibbo-Suppressed Decay $D^+\to  K^+π^+π^-π^0$ and Evidence for $D^+\to K^+ω$;BESIII Collaboration;2020/07/15;http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07674v2;Using $2.93 \rm fb^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$ collision data collected at acenter-of-mass energy of 3.773 GeV with the BESIII detector, the firstobservation of the doubly Cabibbo-suppressed decay $D^+\to K^+\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$is reported. After removing decays that contain narrow intermediate resonances,including $D^+\to K^+\eta$, $D^+\to K^+\omega$, and $D^+\to K^+\phi$, thebranching fraction of the decay $D^+\to K^+\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ is measured to be$(1.13 \pm 0.08_{\rm stat} \pm 0.03_{\rm syst})\times 10^{-3}$. The ratio ofbranching fractions of $D^+\to K^+\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ over $D^+\toK^-\pi^+\pi^+\pi^0$ is found to be $(1.81\pm0.15)$\%, which corresponds to$(6.28\pm0.52)\tan^4\theta_C$, where $\theta_C$ is the Cabibbo mixing angle.This ratio is significantly larger than the corresponding ratios for otherdoubly Cabibbo-suppressed decays. The asymmetry of the branching fractions ofcharge-conjugated decays $D^\pm\to K^\pm\pi^\pm\pi^\mp\pi^0$ is alsodetermined, and no evidence of $CP$ violation is found. In addition, the firstevidence of the $D^+\to K^+\omega$ decay, with a statistical significance of3.3$\sigma$, is presented and its decay branching fraction is determined to be$({5.7^{+2.5}_{-2.1}}_{\rm stat}\pm0.2_{\rm syst})\times10^{-5}$.

In this energy regime the population of\Delta(1232) resonances plays an important role in the way energy isdistributed between intrinsic excitation energy and kinetic energy of thehadrons in the fireball. The triple differential d3N/dM{\pi}pdpTdydistributions of correlated {\pi}p pairs have been determined by subtractingthe {\pi}p combinatorial background using an iterative method. Theinvariant-mass distributions in the \Delta(1232) mass region show strongdeviations from a Breit-Wigner function with vacuum width and mass. The yieldof correlated pion-proton pairs exhibits a complex isospin, rapidity andtransverse-momentum dependence. In the invariant mass range 1.1 < Minv (GeV/c2)< 1.4, the yield is found to be similar for {\pi}+p and {\pi}-p pairs, and tofollow a power law <Apart>^{\alpha}, where <Apart> is the mean number ofparticipating nucleons.

Here we introduce a new method to testhadronic interaction models without relying on the absolute energy calibration,and apply it to events with primary energy 6-16 EeV (E_CM = 110-170 TeV), whoselongitudinal development and lateral distribution were simultaneously measuredby the Pierre Auger Observatory. The average hadronic shower is 1.33 +- 0.16(1.61 +- 0.21) times larger than predicted using the leading LHC-tuned modelsEPOS-LHC (QGSJetII-04), with a corresponding excess of muons.
ArXiv;The Calibration of the O/H Abundance Indicators for Extragalactic H II  Regions Based on O II Recombination Lines;M. Peimbert, A. Peimbert, C. Esteban, J. Garcia-Rojas, F. Bresolin, L. Carigi, M. T. Ruiz, A. R. Lopez-Sanchez;2006/08/21;http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0608440v1;Based on O II recombination lines we present a new calibration (called OII[RL]) of Pagel's O23 indicator to determine the O/H abundance ratio inextragalactic H II regions and emission line galaxies. The O II(RL) calibrationproduces O/H abundances about a factor of two higher than those derived fromthe T(4363) method with t2 = 0.00. The O II(RL) calibration has implicationsfor the study of different properties of emission line galaxies such as theirmetallicity, star formation rate, and initial mass function. The O II(RL)calibration also affects the abundance determinations based on other O/Hindicators, that include collisionally excited lines, like those known as O3N2,N2, S23, Ar3O3, and S3O3. We argue that the controversy between the T(4363)method and the photoionization models method to derive O/H values is mainly dueto temperature variations inside the observed H II regions.

The searchwas performed with deep inelastic scattering events at an $ep$ centre-of-massenergy of 318 GeV for exchanged photon virtuality, $Q^2$, between 20 and 100$\rm{} GeV^{2}$. Contrary to evidence presented for such a state around 1.52GeV in a previous ZEUS analysis using a sample of 121 pb$^{-1}$ taken in1996-2000, no resonance peak was found in the $p(\bar{p})K^0_S$ invariant-massdistribution in the range 1.45-1.7 GeV.

Zotkin;2012/10/19;http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.5511v1;The production of Z0 bosons in the reaction ep -> eZ0p*, where p* stands fora proton or a low-mass nucleon resonance, has been studied in ep collisions atHERA using the ZEUS detector. The analysis is based on a data sample collectedbetween 1996 and 2007, amounting to 496 pb-1 of integrated luminosity. The Z0was measured in the hadronic decay mode. The elasticity of the events wasensured by a cut on eta_max < 3.0, where eta_max is the maximum pseudorapidityof energy deposits in the calorimeter defined with respect to the proton beamdirection. A signal was observed at the Z0 mass. The cross section of thereaction ep -> eZ0p* was measured to be sigma(ep -> eZ0p*) = 0.13 +/- 0.06(stat.) +/- 0.01 (syst.) pb, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction of0.16 pb. This is the first measurement of Z0 production in ep collisions.

The single-differential cross-sections d(sigma)/dQ2, d(sigma)/dx andd(sigma)/dy and the reduced cross-section were measured in the kinematic regionQ2 > 185 GeV2 and y < 0.9, where Q2 is the four-momentum transfer squared, xthe Bjorken scaling variable, and y the inelasticity of the interaction. Themeasurements were performed separately for positively and negatively polarisedpositron beams. The measurements are based on an integrated luminosity of 135.5pb-1 collected with the ZEUS detector in 2006 and 2007 at a centre-of-massenergy of 318 GeV. The structure functions F3 and F3(gamma)Z were determined bycombining the e+p results presented in this paper with previously published e-pneutral current results. The asymmetry parameter A+ is used to demonstrate theparity violation predicted in electroweak interactions. The measurements arewell described by the predictions of the Standard Model.

Jets were identified using the kT, anti-kTor SIScone jet algorithms in the laboratory frame. Single-differential crosssections are presented as functions of the jet transverse energy, ETjet, andpseudorapidity, etajet, for jets with ETjet > 17 GeV and -1 < etajet < 2.5. Inaddition, measurements of double-differential inclusive-jet cross sections arepresented as functions of ETjet in different regions of etajet.Next-to-leading-order QCD calculations give a good description of themeasurements, except for jets with low ETjet and high etajet. The influence ofnon-perturbative effects not related to hadronisation was studied. Measurementsof the ratios of cross sections using different jet algorithms are alsopresented; the measured ratios are well described by calculations including upto O(alphas2) terms. Values of alphas(Mz) were extracted from the measurementsand the energy-scale dependence of the coupling was determined. The value ofalphas(Mz) extracted from the measurements based on the kT jet algorithm isalphas(Mz) = 0.1206 +0.0023 -0.0022 (exp.) +0.0042 -0.0035 (th.); the resultsfrom the anti-kT and SIScone algorithms are compatible with this value and havea similar precision."

The fractions of jets containing b and c quarks wereextracted using the invariant mass of charged tracks associated with secondaryvertices and the decay-length significance of these vertices. Differentialcross sections as a function of jet transverse momentum, $p_{T}^{\text{jet}}$,and pseudorapidity, $\eta^{\text{jet}}$, were measured. The data are comparedwith previous measurements and are well described by next-to-leading-order QCDpredictions.

Zuccarello;2017/09/05;http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01537v3;"We present a novel method to measure precisely the relative spectral responseof the fluorescence telescopes of the Pierre Auger Observatory. We used aportable light source based on a xenon flasher and a monochromator to measurethe relative spectral efficiencies of eight telescopes in steps of 5 nm from280 nm to 440 nm. Each point in a scan had approximately 2 nm FWHM out of themonochromator. Different sets of telescopes in the observatory have differentoptical components, and the eight telescopes measured represent two each of thefour combinations of components represented in the observatory. We made anend-to-end measurement of the response from different combinations of opticalcomponents, and the monochromator setup allowed for more precise and completemeasurements than our previous multi-wavelength calibrations. We find anoverall uncertainty in the calibration of the spectral response of most of thetelescopes of 1.5% for all wavelengths; the six oldest telescopes have largeroverall uncertainties of about 2.2%. We also report changes in physicsmeasureables due to the change in calibration, which are generally small."

ArXiv;Hot Gas in the Galactic Thick Disk and Halo Near the Draco Cloud;R. L. Shelton, D. B. Henley, W. V. Dixon;2010/08/17;http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.2915v1;This paper examines the ultraviolet and X-ray photons generated by hot gas inthe Galactic thick disk or halo in the Draco region of the northern hemisphere.Our analysis uses the intensities from four ions, C IV, O VI, O VII, and OVIII, sampling temperatures of ~100,000 to ~3,000,000 K. We measured the O VI,O VII and O VIII intensities from FUSE and XMM-Newton data and subtracted offthe local contributions in order to deduce the thick disk/halo contributions.These were supplemented with published C IV intensity and O VI column densitymeasurements. Our estimate of the thermal pressure in the O VI-rich thickdisk/halo gas, p_{th}/k = 6500^{+2500}_{-2600} K cm^{-3}, suggests that thethick disk/halo is more highly pressurized than would be expected fromtheoretical analyses. The ratios of C IV to O VI to O VII to O VIII,intensities were compared with those predicted by theoretical models. Gas whichwas heated to 3,000,000 K then allowed to cool radiatively cannot produceenough C IV or O VI-generated photons per O VII or O VIII-generated photon.Producing enough C IV and O VI emission requires heating additional gas to100,000 < T < 1,000,000 K. However, shock heating, which provides heatingacross this temperature range, overproduces O VI relative to the others.Obtaining the observed mix may require a combination of several processes,including some amount of shock heating, heat conduction, and mixing, as well asradiative cooling of very hot gas.

Zuccarello;2017/10/19;http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07249v1;We present a new method for probing the hadronic interaction models atultra-high energy and extracting details about mass composition. This is doneusing the time profiles of the signals recorded with the water-Cherenkovdetectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The profiles arise from a mix of themuon and electromagnetic components of air-showers. Using the risetimes of therecorded signals we define a new parameter, which we use to compare ourobservations with predictions from simulations. We find, firstly,inconsistencies between our data and predictions over a greater energy rangeand with substantially more events than in previous studies. Secondly, bycalibrating the new parameter with fluorescence measurements from observationsmade at the Auger Observatory, we can infer the depth of shower maximum for asample of over 81,000 events extending from 0.3 EeV to over 100 EeV. Above 30EeV, the sample is nearly fourteen times larger than currently available fromfluorescence measurements and extending the covered energy range by half adecade. The energy dependence of the average depth of shower maximum iscompared to simulations and interpreted in terms of the mean of the logarithmicmass. We find good agreement with previous work and extend the measurement ofthe mean depth of shower maximum to greater energies than before, reducingsignificantly the statistical uncertainty associated with the inferences aboutmass composition.

Ziegler;2019/12/10;http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04651v1;Our objective is to estimate the C/O ratio in the atmosphere of beta Pictorisb and obtain an estimate of the dynamical mass of the planet, as well as torefine its orbital parameters using high-precision astrometry. We used theGRAVITY instrument with the four 8.2 m telescopes of the Very Large TelescopeInterferometer to obtain K-band spectro-interferometric data on $\beta$ Pic b.We extracted a medium resolution (R=500) K-band spectrum of the planet and ahigh-precision astrometric position. We estimated the planetary C/O ratio usingtwo different approaches (forward modeling and free retrieval) from twodifferent codes (ExoREM and petitRADTRANS, respectively). Finally, we used asimplified model of two formation scenarios (gravitational collapse andcore-accretion) to determine which can best explain the measured C/O ratio. Ournew astrometry disfavors a circular orbit for $\beta$ Pic b($e=0.15^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$). Combined with previous results and withHipparcos/GAIA measurements, this astrometry points to a planet mass of $M =12.7\pm{}2.2\,M_\mathrm{Jup}$. This value is compatible with the mass derivedwith the free-retrieval code petitRADTRANS using spectral data only. Theforward modeling and free-retrieval approches yield very similar resultsregarding the atmosphere of beta Pic b. In particular, the C/O ratios derivedwith the two codes are identical ($0.43\pm{}0.05$ vs $0.43^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$).We argue that if the stellar C/O in $\beta$ Pic is Solar, then this combinationof a very high mass and a low C/O ratio for the planet suggests a formationthrough core-accretion, with strong planetesimal enrichment.

Zotkin;2016/03/31;http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09628v2;A simultaneous fit of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and electroweakparameters to HERA data on deep inelastic scattering is presented. The inputdata are the neutral current and charged current inclusive cross sections whichwere previously used in the QCD analysis leading to the HERAPDF2.0 PDFs. Inaddition, the polarisation of the electron beam was taken into account for theZEUS data recorded between 2004 and 2007. Results on the vector andaxial-vector couplings of the Z boson to u- and d-type quarks, on the value ofthe electroweak mixing angle and the mass of the W boson are presented. Thevalues obtained for the electroweak parameters are in agreement with StandardModel predictions.

Zuccarello;2017/09/21;http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07321v1;Cosmic rays are atomic nuclei arriving from outer space that reach thehighest energies observed in nature. Clues to their origin come from studyingthe distribution of their arrival directions. Using $3 \times 10^4$ cosmic raysabove $8 \times 10^{18}$ electron volts, recorded with the Pierre AugerObservatory from a total exposure of 76,800 square kilometers steradian year,we report an anisotropy in the arrival directions. The anisotropy, detected atmore than the 5.2$\sigma$ level of significance, can be described by a dipolewith an amplitude of $6.5_{-0.9}^{+1.3}$% towards right ascension $\alpha_{d} =100 \pm 10$ degrees and declination $\delta_{d} = -24_{-13}^{+12}$ degrees.That direction indicates an extragalactic origin for these ultra-high energyparticles.

More than 15 years ago, wepublished a technical design report (TDR)[https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/270060419] to describe the hardwaredesign and requirements to achieve our sensitivity goal of 0.2 eV at 90% C.L.on the neutrino mass. Since then there has been considerable progress,culminating in the publication of first neutrino mass results with the entirebeamline operating [arXiv:1909.06048]. In this paper, we document the currentstate of all completed beamline components (as of the first neutrino massmeasurement campaign), demonstrate our ability to reliably and stably controlthem over long times, and present details on their respective commissioningcampaigns.

Ourresult is $0.64(11)\%$, which is a factor $\sim 2$ smaller than the previouslyestablished literature value, but is in agreement with another recentmeasurement. This could indicate that the Hoyle state is more clustered thanpreviously believed. The angular correlation of the Hoyle state $\gamma$cascade has also been measured for the first time. It is consistent withtheoretical predictions.

Zuccarello;2017/02/05;http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01392v3;An in-situ calibration of a logarithmic periodic dipole antenna with afrequency coverage of 30 MHz to 80 MHz is performed. Such antennas are part ofa radio station system used for detection of cosmic ray induced air showers atthe Engineering Radio Array of the Pierre Auger Observatory, the so-calledAuger Engineering Radio Array (AERA). The directional and frequencycharacteristics of the broadband antenna are investigated using a remotelypiloted aircraft (RPA) carrying a small transmitting antenna. The antennasensitivity is described by the vector effective length relating the measuredvoltage with the electric-field components perpendicular to the incoming signaldirection. The horizontal and meridional components are determined with anoverall uncertainty of 7.4^{+0.9}_{-0.3} % and 10.3^{+2.8}_{-1.7} %respectively. The measurement is used to correct a simulated response of thefrequency and directional response of the antenna. In addition, the influenceof the ground conductivity and permittivity on the antenna response issimulated. Both have a negligible influence given the ground conditionsmeasured at the detector site. The overall uncertainties of the vectoreffective length components result in an uncertainty of 8.8^{+2.1}_{-1.3} % inthe square root of the energy fluence for incoming signal directions withzenith angles smaller than 60{\deg}.

Zuccarello;2016/09/14;http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04451v2;We present a search for ultra-relativistic magnetic monopoles with the PierreAuger Observatory. Such particles, possibly a relic of phase transitions in theearly universe, would deposit a large amount of energy along their path throughthe atmosphere, comparable to that of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs).The air shower profile of a magnetic monopole can be effectively distinguishedby the fluorescence detector from that of standard UHECRs. No candidate wasfound in the data collected between 2004 and 2012, with an expected backgroundof less than 0.1 event from UHECRs. The corresponding 90% confidence level(C.L.) upper limits on the flux of ultra-relativistic magnetic monopoles rangefrom $10^{-19}$ (cm$^{2}$ sr s)$^{-1}$ for a Lorentz factor $\gamma=10^9$ to$2.5 \times10^{-21}$ (cm$^{2}$ sr s)$^{-1}$ for $\gamma=10^{12}$. These results- the first obtained with a UHECR detector - improve previously publishedlimits by up to an order of magnitude.

Zotkin;2011/11/15;http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3526v2;Scaled momentum distributions for the strange hadrons K0s and Lambda/barLambda were measured in deep inelastic ep scattering with the ZEUS detector atHERA using an integrated luminosity of 330 pb-1. The evolution of thesedistributions with the photon virtuality, Q2, was studied in the kinematicregion 10<Q2<40000 GeV2 and 0.001<x<0.75, where x is the Bjorken scalingvariable. Clear scaling violations are observed. Predictions based on differentapproaches to fragmentation were compared to the measurements.Leading-logarithm parton-shower Monte Carlo calculations interfaced to the Lundstring fragmentation model describe the data reasonably well in the whole rangemeasured. Next-to-leading-order QCD calculations based on fragmentationfunctions, FFs, extracted from e+e- data alone, fail to describe themeasurements. The calculations based on FFs extracted from a global analysisincluding e+e-, ep and pp data give an improved description. The measurementspresented in this paper have the potential to further constrain the FFs ofquarks, anti-quarks and gluons yielding K0s and Lambda/bar Lambda strangehadrons.
ArXiv;Large values of $L$-functions on $1$-line;Anup B. Dixit, Kamalakshya Mahatab;2019/01/06;http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01625v4;In this paper, we study lower bounds of a general family of $L$-functions onthe $1$-line. More precisely, we show that for any $F(s)$ in this family, thereexists arbitrary large $t$ such that $F(1+it)\geq e^{\gamma_F} (\log_2 t +\log_3 t)^m + O(1)$, where $m$ is the order of the pole of $F(s)$ at $s=1$.This is a generalization of the same result of Aistleitner, Munsch and thesecond author for the Riemann zeta-function. As a consequence, we get lowerbounds for large values of Dedekind zeta-functions and Rankin-Selberg$L$-functions of the type $L(s,f\times f)$ on the $1$-line.

Wieleczko;2000/09/06;http://arxiv.org/abs/nucl-ex/0009004v1;The quasi-projectile (QP) properties are investigated in the Ar+Ni collisionsat 95 A.MeV taking into account the intermediate velocity emission. Indeed, inthis reaction, between 52 and 95 A.MeV bombarding energies, the number ofparticles emitted in the intermediate velocity region is related to the overlapvolume between projectile and target. Mean transverse energies of theseparticles are found particularly high. In this context, the mass of the QPdecreases linearly with the impact parameter from peripheral to centralcollisions whereas its excitation energy increases up to 8 A.MeV. These resultsare compared to previous analyses assuming a pure binary scenario.

The fit has been performed for energies above $5 \cdot 10^{18}$eV, i.e.~the region of the all-particle spectrum above the so-called ""ankle""feature. The astrophysical model we adopted consists of identical sourcesuniformly distributed in a comoving volume, where nuclei are acceleratedthrough a rigidity-dependent mechanism. The fit results suggest sourcescharacterized by relatively low maximum injection energies, hard spectra andheavy chemical composition. We also show that uncertainties about physicalquantities relevant to UHECR propagation and shower development have anon-negligible impact on the fit results."

Zuccarello;2018/06/14;http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05386v2;With the Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) of the Pierre AugerObservatory, we have observed the radio emission from 561 extensive air showerswith zenith angles between 60$^\circ$ and 84$^\circ$. In contrast to airshowers with more vertical incidence, these inclined air showers illuminatelarge ground areas of several km$^2$ with radio signals detectable in the 30 to80\,MHz band. A comparison of the measured radio-signal amplitudes with MonteCarlo simulations of a subset of 50 events for which we reconstruct the energyusing the Auger surface detector shows agreement within the uncertainties ofthe current analysis. As expected for forward-beamed radio emission undergoingno significant absorption or scattering in the atmosphere, the area illuminatedby radio signals grows with the zenith angle of the air shower. Inclined airshowers with EeV energies are thus measurable with sparse radio-antenna arrayswith grid sizes of a km or more. This is particularly attractive as radiodetection provides direct access to the energy in the electromagnetic cascadeof an air shower, which in case of inclined air showers is not accessible byarrays of particle detectors on the ground.

Zuccarello;2016/12/13;http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04155v2;Simultaneous measurements of air showers with the fluorescence and surfacedetectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory allow a sensitive search for EeVphoton point sources. Several Galactic and extragalactic candidate objects aregrouped in classes to reduce the statistical penalty of many trials from thatof a blind search and are analyzed for a significant excess above thebackground expectation. The presented search does not find any evidence forphoton emission at candidate sources, and combined $p$-values for every classare reported. Particle and energy flux upper limits are given for selectedcandidate sources. These limits significantly constrain predictions of EeVproton emission models from non-transient Galactic and nearby extragalacticsources, as illustrated for the particular case of the Galactic center region.

Zuccarello;2016/12/05;http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01517v3;A search for ultra-high energy photons with energies above 1 EeV is performedusing nine years of data collected by the Pierre Auger Observatory in hybridoperation mode. An unprecedented separation power between photon and hadronprimaries is achieved by combining measurements of the longitudinal air-showerdevelopment with the particle content at ground measured by the fluorescenceand surface detectors, respectively. Only three photon candidates at energies 1- 2 EeV are found, which is compatible with the expected hadron-inducedbackground. Upper limits on the integral flux of ultra-high energy photons of0.038, 0.010, 0.009, 0.008 and 0.007 km$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ are derivedat 95% C.L. for energy thresholds of 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 EeV. These limits boundthe fractions of photons in the all-particle integral flux below 0.14%, 0.17%,0.42%, 0.86% and 2.9%. For the first time the photon fraction at EeV energiesis constrained at the sub-percent level. The improved limits are below the fluxof diffuse photons predicted by some astrophysical scenarios for cosmogenicphoton production. The new results rule-out the early top-down models $-$ inwhich ultra-high energy cosmic rays are produced by, e.g., the decay ofsuper-massive particles $-$ and challenge the most recent super-heavy darkmatter models.

Beta-decay electrons from ahigh-purity gaseous molecular tritium source are analyzed by a high-resolutionMAC-E filter down to 40 eV below the endpoint at 18.57 keV. We consider theframework with three active neutrinos and one sterile neutrino of mass $m_{4}$.The analysis is sensitive to a fourth mass state $m^2_{4} \lesssim$ 1000 eV$^2$and to active-to-sterile neutrino mixing down to $|U_{e4}|^2 \gtrsim2\cdot10^{-2}$. No significant spectral distortion is observed and exclusionbounds on the sterile mass and mixing are reported. These new limits supersedethe Mainz results and improve the Troitsk bound for $m^2_{4} <$ 30 eV$^2$. Thereactor and gallium anomalies are constrained for $ 100 < \Delta{m}^2_{41} <1000$ eV$^2$.

The techniques and performance of searching forUltra-High Energy neutrinos, photons and neutrons are described. Some of themost relevant results are reviewed, such as stringent upper bounds that wereplaced to a flux of diffuse cosmogenic neutrinos and photons, bounds placed onneutrinos emitted from compact binary mergers that were detected by LIGO andVirgo during their first and second observing runs, as well as searches forhigh energy photons and neutrons from the Galactic center that constrain theproperties of the putative Galactic PeVatron, observed by the H.E.S.S.\collaboration. The observation of directional correlations between ultra-highenergy cosmic rays and either high energy astrophysical neutrinos or specificsource populations, weighted by their electromagnetic radiation, are alsodiscussed. They constitute additional multi-messenger approaches aimed atidentifying the sources of high energy cosmic rays.

This search is conducted by measuring the angular power spectrumand performing a needlet wavelet analysis in two independent energy ranges.Both analyses are complementary since the angular power spectrum achieves abetter performance in identifying large-scale patterns while the needletwavelet analysis, considering the parameters used in this work, presents ahigher efficiency in detecting smaller-scale anisotropies, potentiallyproviding directional information on any observed anisotropies. No deviationfrom isotropy is observed on any angular scale in the energy range between 4and 8 EeV. Above 8 EeV, an indication for a dipole moment is captured; while noother deviation from isotropy is observed for moments beyond the dipole one.The corresponding $p$-values obtained after accounting for searches blindlyperformed at several angular scales, are $1.3 \times 10^{-5}$ in the case ofthe angular power spectrum, and $2.5 \times 10^{-3}$ in the case of the needletanalysis. While these results are consistent with previous reports making useof the same data set, they provide extensions of the previous works through thethorough scans of the angular scales."

The fraction ofevents with beauty quarks in the data was determined using the distribution ofthe transverse momentum of the muon relative to the jet. The cross section forbeauty production was measured in the kinematic range of photon virtuality, Q^2> 2 Gev^2, and inelasticity, 0.05 < y < 0.7, with the requirement of a muon anda jet. Total and differential cross sections are presented and compared to QCDpredictions. The beauty contribution to the structure function F_2 wasextracted and is compared to theoretical predictions.

Zonca;2012/08/27;http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.5483v1;"Using precise full-sky observations from Planck, and applying several methodsof component separation, we identify and characterize the emission from theGalactic ""haze"" at microwave wavelengths. The haze is a distinct component ofdiffuse Galactic emission, roughly centered on the Galactic centre, and extendsto |b| ~35 deg in Galactic latitude and |l| ~15 deg in longitude. By combiningthe Planck data with observations from the WMAP we are able to determine thespectrum of this emission to high accuracy, unhindered by the large systematicbiases present in previous analyses. The derived spectrum is consistent withpower-law emission with a spectral index of -2.55 +/- 0.05, thus excludingfree-free emission as the source and instead favouring hard-spectrumsynchrotron radiation from an electron population with a spectrum (numberdensity per energy) dN/dE ~ E^-2.1. At Galactic latitudes |b|<30 deg, themicrowave haze morphology is consistent with that of the Fermi gamma-ray ""haze""or ""bubbles,"" indicating that we have a multi-wavelength view of a distinctcomponent of our Galaxy. Given both the very hard spectrum and the extendednature of the emission, it is highly unlikely that the haze electrons resultfrom supernova shocks in the Galactic disk. Instead, a new mechanism forcosmic-ray acceleration in the centre of our Galaxy is implied."

Zuccarello;2019/01/23;http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08040v3;The determination of the primary energy of extensive air showers using thefluorescence detection technique requires an estimation of the energy carriedaway by particles that do not deposit all their energy in the atmosphere. Thisestimation is typically made using Monte Carlo simulations and thus depends onthe assumed primary particle mass and on model predictions for neutrino andmuon production. In this work we present a new method to obtain the invisibleenergy from events detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory. The method usesmeasurements of the muon number at ground level, and it allows us to reducesignificantly the systematic uncertainties related to the mass composition andthe high energy hadronic interaction models, and consequently to improve theestimation of the energy scale of the Observatory.

A fit of the integratedelectron spectrum over a narrow interval around the kinematic endpoint at 18.57keV gives an effective neutrino mass square value of $(-1.0^{+0.9}_{-1.1})$eV$^2$. From this we derive an upper limit of 1.1 eV (90$\%$ confidence level)on the absolute mass scale of neutrinos. This value coincides with the KATRINsensitivity.

Sensitivities are compared forthese accelerators using models based on the effective Lagrangian approach. Thesensitivities described here are for measurement of generic parameters kappa_v,lambda_v, etc., defined in the text. Pre-LHC measurements will not probe thesecouplings to precision better than O(1/10). The LHC should be sensitive tobetter than O(1/100), while a future NLC should achieve sensitivity ofO(1/1000) to O(1/10000) for center of mass energies ranging from 0.5 to 1.5TeV.

In this work, we present thefirst measurement of the average shower profile in traversed atmospheric depthat the Pierre Auger Observatory. The shapes of profiles are well reproduced bythe Gaisser-Hillas parametrization within the range studied, for E > 10^{17.8}eV. A detailed analysis of the systematic uncertainties is performed using 10years of data and a full detector simulation. The average shape is quantifiedusing two variables related to the width and asymmetry of the profile, and theresults are compared with predictions of hadronic interaction models fordifferent primary particles.

Zumbruch;2020/05/25;http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12217v2;Flow coefficients $v_{n}$ of the orders $n = 1 - 6$ are measured with theHigh-Acceptance DiElectron Spectrometer (HADES) at GSI for protons, deuteronsand tritons as a function of centrality, transverse momentum and rapidity inAu+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.4$ GeV. Combining the information fromthe flow coefficients of all orders allows to construct for the first time, atcollision energies of a few GeV, a multi-differential picture of the angularemission pattern of these particles. It reflects the complicated interplaybetween the effect of the central fireball pressure on the emission ofparticles and their subsequent interaction with spectator matter. The highprecision information on higher order flow coefficients is a major step forwardin constraining the equation-of-state of dense baryonic matter.

The product branching fraction of $J/\psi\rightarrowp\bar{p}a_{0}(980)\rightarrow p\bar{p}\pi^{0}\eta$ is measured to be$(6.8\pm1.2\pm1.3)\times 10^{-5}$, where the first error is statistical and thesecond is systematic. This measurement provides information on the $a_{0}$production near threshold coupling to $p\bar{p}$ and improves the understandingof the dynamics of $J/\psi$ decays to four body processes.

All three $N=1-0$fine-structure transitions of OH$^+$ at 909, 971, and 1033GHz and bothfine-structure components of the doublet {\it ortho}-H$_2$O$^+$ $1_{11}-0_{00}$transition at 1115 and 1139GHz were detected; an upper limit was obtained forH$_3$O$^+$. OH$^+$ and H$_2$O$^+$ are observed purely in absorption, showing anarrow component at the source velocity of 9 kms$^{-1}$, and a broadblueshifted absorption similar to that reported recently for HF and {\itpara}-H$_{2}^{18}$O, and attributed to the low velocity outflow of Orion KL. Weestimate column densities of OH$^+$ and H$_2$O$^+$ for the 9 km s$^{-1}$component of $9 \pm 3 \times 10^{12}$cm$^{-2}$ and $7 \pm 2 \times10^{12}$cm$^{-2}$, and those in the outflow of $1.9 \pm 0.7 \times10^{13}$cm$^{-2}$ and $1.0 \pm 0.3 \times 10^{13}$cm$^{-2}$. Upper limits of$2.4\times 10^{12}$cm$^{-2}$ and $8.7\times 10^{12}$cm$^{-2}$ were derived forthe column densities of {\it ortho} and {\it para}-H$_3$O$^+$ from transitionsnear 985 and 1657GHz. The column densities of the three ions are up to an orderof magnitude lower than those obtained from recent observations of W31C andW49N. The comparatively low column densities may be explained by a higher gasdensity despite the assumption of a very high ionization rate."

During summer 2011 and 2012 it underwenta series of upgrades, involving the exchange of the MAGIC-I camera and itstrigger system, as well as the upgrade of the readout system of bothtelescopes. We use observations of the Crab Nebula taken at low and mediumzenith angles to assess the key performance parameters of the MAGIC stereosystem. For low zenith angle observations, the standard trigger threshold ofthe MAGIC telescopes is ~50GeV. The integral sensitivity for point-like sourceswith Crab Nebula-like spectrum above 220GeV is (0.66+/-0.03)% of Crab Nebulaflux in 50 h of observations. The angular resolution, defined as the sigma of a2-dimensional Gaussian distribution, at those energies is < 0.07 degree, whilethe energy resolution is 16%. We also re-evaluate the effect of the systematicuncertainty on the data taken with the MAGIC telescopes after the upgrade. Weestimate that the systematic uncertainties can be divided in the followingcomponents: < 15% in energy scale, 11-18% in flux normalization and +/-0.15 forthe energy spectrum power-law slope.

We measure the asymmetry $\mathcal{A}^{CP}_{K\pi}$ of thebranching fractions of $D \to K^-\pi^+$ in $CP$-odd and $CP$-even eigenstatesto be $(12.7\pm1.3\pm0.7)\times10^{-2}$. $\mathcal{A}^{CP}_{K\pi}$ can be usedto extract the strong phase difference $\delta_{K\pi}$ between the doublyCabibbo-suppressed process $\overline{D}{}^{0}\to K^-\pi^+$ and theCabibbo-favored process $D^0\to K^- \pi^+$. Using world-average values ofexternal parameters, we obtain $\cos\delta_{K\pi} = 1.02\pm0.11\pm0.06\pm0.01$.Here, the first and second uncertainties are statistical and systematic,respectively, while the third uncertainty arises from the external parameters.This is the most precise measurement of $\delta_{K\pi}$ to date.

Zou;2013/12/02;http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0374v2;We report a measurement of the branching fraction $B(D^+ \rightarrow \mu^+\nu_{\mu}) = [3.71 \pm 0.19 (\rm stat) \pm 0.06 (\rm sys)]\times 10^{-4}$ basedon 2.92 ${\rm fb^{-1}}$ of data accumulated at $\sqrt{s}=3.773$ GeV with theBESIII detector at the BEPCII collider. This measurement, in conjunction withthe Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $|V_{\rm cd}|$ determined from aglobal Standard Model fit, implies a value for the weak decay constant$f_{D^+}=(203.2 \pm 5.3 \pm 1.8)$ MeV. Additionally, using this branchingfraction measurement together with a Lattice QCD prediction for $f_{D^+}$, wefind $|V_{\rm cd}|=0.2210\pm 0.0058 \pm 0.0047$. In either case, these are themost precise results for these quantities to date.

S. Zotkin;2013/12/16;http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4438v2;The neutral current e+/-p cross section has been measured up to values ofBjorken x of approximately 1 with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an integratedluminosity of 187 inv. pb of e-p and 142 inv. pb of e+p collisions at sqrt(s) =318GeV. Differential cross sections in x and Q2, the exchanged bosonvirtuality, are presented for Q2 geq 725GeV2. An improved reconstruction methodand greatly increased amount of data allows a finer binning in the high-xregion of the neutral current cross section and leads to a measurement withmuch improved precision compared to a similar earlier analysis.

Zou;2014/05/13;http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3190v2;By using a 2.92 fb$^{-1}$ data sample taken at $\sqrt{s} = 3.773$ GeV withthe BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII collider, we search for theradiative transitions $\psi(3770)\to\gamma\eta_c$ and $\gamma\eta_c(2S)$through the hadronic decays $\eta_c(\eta_c(2S))\to K^0_SK^\pm\pi^\mp$. Nosignificant excess of signal events above background is observed. We set upperlimits at a 90% confidence level for the product branching fractions to be$\mathcal{B}(\psi(3770)\to\gamma\eta_c)\times \mathcal{B}(\eta_c\toK^0_SK^\pm\pi^\mp) < 1.6\times10^{-5}$ and$\mathcal{B}(\psi(3770)\to\gamma\eta_c(2S))\times \mathcal{B}(\eta_c(2S)\toK^0_SK^\pm\pi^\mp) < 5.6\times10^{-6}$. Combining our result with world-averagevalues of $\mathcal{B}(\eta_c(\eta_c(2S))\to K^0_SK^\pm\pi^\mp)$, we find thebranching fractions $\mathcal{B}(\psi(3770)\to\gamma\eta_c) < 6.8\times10^{-4}$and $\mathcal{B}(\psi(3770)\to\gamma\eta_c(2S)) < 2.0\times10^{-3}$ at a 90%confidence level.

Zotkin;2014/05/27;http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6915v2;The production of beauty and charm quarks in ep interactions has been studiedwith the ZEUS detector at HERA for exchanged four-momentum squared 5 < Q^2 <1000 GeV^2 using an integrated luminosity of 354 pb^{-1}. The beauty and charmcontent in events with at least one jet have been extracted using the invariantmass of charged tracks associated with secondary vertices and the decay-lengthsignificance of these vertices. Differential cross sections as a function ofQ^2, Bjorken x, jet transverse energy and pseudorapidity were measured andcompared with next-to-leading-order QCD calculations. The beauty and charmcontributions to the proton structure functions were extracted from thedouble-differential cross section as a function of x and Q^2. The runningbeauty-quark mass, m_b at the scale m_b, was determined from a QCD fit atnext-to-leading order to HERA data for the first time and found to be 4.07 \pm0.14 (fit} ^{+0.01}_{-0.07} (mod.) ^{+0.05}_{-0.00} (param.) ^{+0.08}_{-0.05}(theo) GeV.

This is the most preciseresult to date, due to the largest $\psi(3686)$ sample, improved signalreconstruction efficiency, good simulation of the detector performance, and amore accurate knowledge of the continuum contribution. Using the branchingfraction of $J/\psi \to \omega K^+ K^-$, the ratio $\mathcal{B}(\psi(3868) \toK^+K^-) / \mathcal{B}(J/\psi \to K^+K^-)$ is determined to be $(18.4 \pm3.7)\,\%$. This constitutes a significantly improved test of the $12\,\%$ rule,with the uncertainty now dominated by the $J/\psi$ branching fraction.

Zotkin;2014/05/20;http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5068v2;The photoproduction of $D^{*\pm}$ mesons has been measured with the ZEUSdetector at HERA at three different ep centre-of-mass energies, $\sqrt{s}$, of318, 251 and 225 GeV. For each data set, $D^*$ mesons were required to havetransverse momentum, $p_T^{D^*}$, and pseudorapidity, $\eta^{D^*}$, in theranges $1.9 < p_T^{D^*} < 20$ GeV and $|\eta^{D^*}|<1.6$. The events wererequired to have a virtuality of the incoming photon, $Q^2$, of less than 1GeV$^2$. The dependence on $\sqrt{s}$ was studied by normalising to thehigh-statistics measurement at $\sqrt{s} =318$ GeV. This led to thecancellation of a number of systematic effects both in data and theory.Predictions from next-to-leading-order QCD describe the $\sqrt{s}$ dependenceof the data well.

The double ratio(K-/K+)W / (K-/K+)C is found to be 0.319 \pm 0.009(stat)+0.014-0.012 (syst)indicating a larger absorption of K- in heavier targets as compared to lighterones. The measured \phi/K- ratios in \pi-+C and \pi^- +W reactions within theHADES acceptance are found to be equal to $0.55 \pm 0.03(stat)+0.06-0.07$(syst) and to $0.63 \pm 0.05(stat)-0.11+0.11$ (syst), respectively. The similarratios measured in the two different reactions demonstrate for the first timeexperimentally that the dynamics of the \phi meson in nuclear medium isstrongly coupled to the K- dynamics. The large difference in the \phiproduction off C and W nuclei is discussed in terms of a strong \phiN in-mediumcoupling.

Meuris;2018/07/24;http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09330v1;The eXTP (enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry) mission is a major projectof the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and China National SpaceAdministration (CNSA) currently performing an extended phase A study andproposed for a launch by 2025 in a low-earth orbit. The eXTP scientific payloadenvisages a suite of instruments (Spectroscopy Focusing Array, PolarimetryFocusing Array, Large Area Detector and Wide Field Monitor) offeringunprecedented simultaneous wide-band X-ray timing and polarimetry sensitivity.A large European consortium is contributing to the eXTP study and it isexpected to provide key hardware elements, including a Wide Field Monitor(WFM). The WFM instrument for eXTP is based on the design originally proposedfor the LOFT mission within the ESA context. The eXTP/WFM envisages a widefield X-ray monitor system in the 2-50 keV energy range, achieved through thetechnology of the large-area Silicon Drift Detectors. The WFM will consist of 3pairs of coded mask cameras with a total combined Field of View (FoV) of 90x180degrees at zero response and a source localization accuracy of ~1 arcmin. Inthis paper we provide an overview of the WFM instrument design, including newelements with respect to the earlier LOFT configuration, and anticipatedperformance.

Zou;2015/07/24;http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.06824v2;We present a measurement of the azimuthal asymmetries of two charged pions inthe inclusive process $e^+e^-\rightarrow \pi\pi X$ based on a data set of 62$\rm{pb}^{-1}$ at the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=3.65$ GeV collected withthe BESIII detector. These asymmetries can be attributed to the Collinsfragmentation function. We observe a nonzero asymmetry, which increases withincreasing pion momentum. As our energy scale is close to that of the existingsemi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering experimental data, the measuredasymmetries are important inputs for the global analysis of extracting thequark transversity distribution inside the nucleon and are valuable to explorethe energy evolution of the spin-dependent fragmentation function.

Using the secondary pion beam at SIS18, the two pionproduction in the second resonance region has been investigated to unravel therole of the $N(1520) \frac{3}{2}^-$ resonance in the intermediate $\rho$production. Results on exclusive channels with one pion ($\pi^{-}p$) and twopions ($\pi^{+}\pi^{-}n$, $\pi^{0}\pi^{-}p$) in the final state measured in the$\pi^{-}-p$ reaction at four different pion beam momenta (0.650, 0.685, 0.733,and 0.786 GeV/c) are presented. The excitation function of the differentpartial waves and $\Delta\pi$, $N\sigma$ and $N\rho$ isobar configurations isobtained, using the Bonn-Gatchina partial wave analysis. The $N(1520)\frac{3}{2}^-$ resonance is found to dominate the $N\rho$ final state with thebranching ratio $BR=12.2 \pm 1.9\%$.

Zou;2014/06/10;http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2486v2;The process $e^+e^-\rightarrow p\overline{p}\pi^0$ has been studied byanalyzing data collected at $\sqrt{s}=3.773$ GeV, at $\sqrt{s}=3.650$ GeV, andduring a $\psi(3770)$ line shape scan with the BESIII detector at the BEPCIIcollider. The Born cross section of $p \overline{p} \pi^0$ in the vicinity ofthe $\psi(3770)$ is measured and the Born cross section of$\psi(3770)\rightarrow p \overline{p} \pi^0$ is extracted consideringinterference between resonant and continuum production amplitudes. Twosolutions with the same probability and a significance of 1.5$\sigma$ arefound, and the Born cross section of $\psi(3770)\rightarrow p \overline{p}\pi^0$ is determined to be less than 0.22 pb at 90% confidence level and$33.8\pm1.8\pm2.1$ pb, respectively. Using the estimated cross section and aconstant decay amplitude approximation, the cross section $\sigma(p\overline{p}\rightarrow \psi(3770) \pi^0)$ is calculated for the kinematic situation of theplanned $\overline{\text{P}}\text{ANDA}$ experiment. The maximum cross sectioncorresponding to the two solutions is expected to be less than $0.79$ nb at 90%confidence level and $122\pm10$ nb at a center of mass energy of 5.26 GeV.

Zou;2014/01/14;http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3083v2;We perform an analysis of the $D^+ \to K^0_S \pi^+ \pi^0$ Dalitz plot using adata set of 2.92 fb$^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$ collisions at the $\psi(3770)$ massaccumulated by the BESIII Experiment, in which 166694 candidate events areselected with a background of 15.1%. The Dalitz plot is found to bewell-represented by a combination of six quasi-two-body decay channels($K^0_S\rho^+$, $K^0_S\rho(1450)^+$, $\overline{K}^{*0}\pi^+$,$\overline{K}_0(1430)^0\pi^+$, $\overline{K}(1680)^0\pi^+$,$\overline{\kappa}^0\pi^+$) plus a small non-resonant component. Using the fitfractions from this analysis, partial branching ratios are updated with higherprecision than previous measurements.

Aloisio;2022/08/03;http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02353v2;Using the data of the Pierre Auger Observatory, we report on a search forsignatures that would be suggestive of super-heavy particles decaying in theGalactic halo. From the lack of signal, we present upper limits for differentenergy thresholds above ${\gtrsim}10^8$\,GeV on the secondary by-product fluxesexpected from the decay of the particles. Assuming that the energy density ofthese super-heavy particles matches that of dark matter observed today, wetranslate the upper bounds on the particle fluxes into tight constraints on thecouplings governing the decay process as a function of the particle mass.Instantons, which are non-perturbative solutions to Yang-Mills equations, cangive rise to decay channels otherwise forbidden and transform stable particlesinto meta-stable ones. Assuming such instanton-induced decay processes, wederive a bound on the reduced coupling constant of gauge interactions in thedark sector: $\alpha_X \lesssim 0.09$, for $10^{9} \lesssim M_X/\text{GeV} <10^{19}$. Conversely, we obtain that, for instance, a reduced coupling constant$\alpha_X = 0.09$ excludes masses $M_X \gtrsim 3\times 10^{13}~$GeV. In thecontext of dark matter production from gravitational interactions alone duringthe reheating epoch, we derive constraints on the parameter space thatinvolves, in addition to $M_X$ and $\alpha_X$, the Hubble rate at the end ofinflation, the reheating efficiency, and the non-minimal coupling of the Higgswith curvature.

Aloisio;2022/03/16;http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08854v3;Instantons, which are non-perturbative solutions to Yang-Mills equations,provide a signal for the occurrence of quantum tunneling between distinctclasses of vacua. They can give rise to decays of particles otherwiseforbidden. Using data collected at the Pierre Auger Observatory, we search forsignatures of such instanton-induced processes that would be suggestive ofsuper-heavy particles decaying in the Galactic halo. These particles could havebeen produced during the post-inflationary epoch and match the relic abundanceof dark matter inferred today. The non-observation of the signatures searchedfor allows us to derive a bound on the reduced coupling constant of gaugeinteractions in the dark sector: $\alpha_X \lesssim 0.09$, for $10^{9} \lesssimM_X/{\rm GeV} < 10^{19}$. Conversely, we obtain that, for instance, a reducedcoupling constant $\alpha_X = 0.09$ excludes masses $M_X \gtrsim 3\times10^{13}~$GeV. In the context of dark matter production from gravitationalinteractions alone, we illustrate how these bounds are complementary to thoseobtained on the Hubble rate at the end of inflation from the non-observation oftensor modes in the cosmological microwave background.

The recent observations of photons withenergies in the $10^{15}$ eV range further motivate searches for evenhigher-energy photons. In this paper, we present a search for photons withenergies exceeding $2{\times}10^{17}$ eV using about 5.5 years of hybrid datafrom the low-energy extensions of the Pierre Auger Observatory.

Zehrer;2021/12/13;http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06773v2;Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) is often described by dispersion relationsof the form $E_i^2=m_i^2+p_i^2+\delta_{i,n} E^{2+n}$ with delta different basedon particle type $i$, with energy $E$, momentum $p$ and rest mass $m$.Kinematics and energy thresholds of interactions are modified once the LIVterms become comparable to the squared masses of the particles involved. Thus,the strongest constraints on the LIV coefficients $\delta_{i,n}$ tend to comefrom the highest energies. At sufficiently high energies, photons produced bycosmic ray interactions as they propagate through the Universe could besubluminal and unattenuated over cosmological distances. Cosmic rayinteractions can also be modified and lead to detectable fingerprints in theenergy spectrum and mass composition observed on Earth. The data collected atthe Pierre Auger Observatory are therefore possibly sensitive to both theelectromagnetic and hadronic sectors of LIV. In this article, we explore thesetwo sectors by comparing the energy spectrum and the composition of cosmic raysand the upper limits on the photon flux from the Pierre Auger Observatory withsimulations including LIV. Constraints on LIV parameters depend strongly on themass composition of cosmic rays at the highest energies. For theelectromagnetic sector, while no constraints can be obtained in the absence ofprotons beyond $10^{19}$ eV, we obtain $\delta_{\gamma,0} > -10^{-21}$,$\delta_{\gamma,1} > -10^{-40}$ eV$^{-1}$ and $\delta_{\gamma,2} > -10^{-58}$eV$^{-2}$ in the case of a subdominant proton component up to $10^{20}$ eV. Forthe hadronic sector, we study the best description of the data as a function ofLIV coefficients and we derive constraints in the hadronic sector such as$\delta_{\mathrm{had},0} < 10^{-19}$, $\delta_{\mathrm{had},1} < 10^{-38}$eV$^{-1}$ and $\delta_{\mathrm{had},2}< 10^{-57}$ eV$^{-2}$ at 5$\sigma$ CL.

Zehrer;2022/06/22;http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10938v1;The development of an extensive air shower depends not only on the nature ofthe primary ultra-high-energy cosmic ray but also on the properties of thehadronic interactions. For energies above those achievable in human-madeaccelerators, hadronic interactions are only accessible through the studies ofextensive air showers, which can be measured at the Pierre Auger Observatory.With its hybrid detector design, the Pierre Auger Observatory measures both thelongitudinal development of showers in the atmosphere and the lateraldistribution of particles that arrive at the ground. This way, observables thatare sensitive to hadronic interactions at ultra-high energies can be obtained.While the hadronic interaction cross-section can be assessed from thelongitudinal profiles, the number of muons and their fluctuations measured withthe ground detectors are linked to other physical properties. In addition tothese direct studies, we discuss here how measurements of the atmospheric depthof the maximum of air-shower profiles and the characteristics of the muonsignal at the ground can be used to test the self-consistency of the post-LHChadronic models.

The data consist of 5514 events above 20 EeV withzenith angles up to 80 deg recorded before 2017 April 30. Sky models have beencreated for two distinct populations of extragalactic gamma-ray emitters:active galactic nuclei from the second catalog of hard Fermi-LAT sources (2FHL)and starburst galaxies from a sample that was examined with Fermi-LAT.Flux-limited samples, which include all types of galaxies from the Swift-BATand 2MASS surveys, have been investigated for comparison. The sky model ofcosmic-ray density constructed using each catalog has two free parameters, thefraction of events correlating with astrophysical objects and an angular scalecharacterizing the clustering of cosmic rays around extragalactic sources. Amaximum-likelihood ratio test is used to evaluate the best values of theseparameters and to quantify the strength of each model by contrast withisotropy. It is found that the starburst model fits the data better than thehypothesis of isotropy with a statistical significance of 4.0 sigma, thehighest value of the test statistic being for energies above 39 EeV. The threealternative models are favored against isotropy with 2.7-3.2 sigmasignificance. The origin of the indicated deviation from isotropy is examinedand prospects for more sensitive future studies are discussed.

Zonca;2013/03/20;http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5075v2;We present the Planck likelihood, a complete statistical description of thetwo-point correlation function of the CMB temperature fluctuations. We use thislikelihood to derive the Planck CMB power spectrum over three decades in l,covering 2 <= l <= 2500. The main source of error at l <= 1500 is cosmicvariance. Uncertainties in small-scale foreground modelling and instrumentalnoise dominate the error budget at higher l's. For l < 50, our likelihoodexploits all Planck frequency channels from 30 to 353 GHz through a physicallymotivated Bayesian component separation technique. At l >= 50, we employ acorrelated Gaussian likelihood approximation based on angular cross-spectraderived from the 100, 143 and 217 GHz channels. We validate our likelihoodthrough an extensive suite of consistency tests, and assess the impact ofresidual foreground and instrumental uncertainties on cosmological parameters.We find good internal agreement among the high-l cross-spectra with residualsof a few uK^2 at l <= 1000. We compare our results with foreground-cleaned CMBmaps, and with cross-spectra derived from the 70 GHz Planck map, and find broadagreement in terms of spectrum residuals and cosmological parameters. Thebest-fit LCDM cosmology is in excellent agreement with preliminary Planckpolarisation spectra. The standard LCDM cosmology is well constrained by Planckby l <= 1500. For example, we report a 5.4 sigma deviation from n_s /= 1.Considering various extensions beyond the standard model, we find no indicationof significant departures from the LCDM framework. Finally, we report a tensionbetween the best-fit LCDM model and the low-l spectrum in the form of a powerdeficit of 5-10% at l <~ 40, significant at 2.5-3 sigma. We do not elaboratefurther on its cosmological implications, but note that this is our mostpuzzling finding in an otherwise remarkably consistent dataset. (Abridged)

One of the SZ candidates detected inthe early months of the mission near to the signal to noise threshold,PLCKG214.6+37.0, was later revealed by XMM-Newton to be a triple system ofgalaxy clusters. We have further investigated this puzzling system with amulti-wavelength approach and we present here the results from a deepXMM-Newton re-observation. The characterisation of the physical properties ofthe three components has allowed us to build a template model to extract thetotal SZ signal of this system with Planck data. We partly reconciled thediscrepancy between the expected SZ signal from X-rays and the observed one,which are now consistent at less than 1.2 sigma. We measured the redshift ofthe three components with the iron lines in the X-ray spectrum, and confirmedthat the three clumps are likely part of the same supercluster structure. Theanalysis of the dynamical state of the three components, as well as the absenceof detectable excess X-ray emission, suggest that we are witnessing theformation of a massive cluster at an early phase of interaction.

Walker;2016/04/25;http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07418v1;The young star beta Pictoris is well known for its dusty debris disk,produced through the grinding down by collisions of planetesimals,kilometre-sized bodies in orbit around the star. In addition to dust, smallamounts of gas are also known to orbit the star, likely the result fromvaporisation of violently colliding dust grains. The disk is seen edge on andfrom previous absorption spectroscopy we know that the gas is very rich incarbon relative to other elements. The oxygen content has been more difficultto assess, however, with early estimates finding very little oxygen in the gasat a C/O ratio 20x higher than the cosmic value. A C/O ratio that high isdifficult to explain and would have far-reaching consequences for planetformation. Here we report on observations by the far-infrared space telescopeHerschel, using PACS, of emission lines from ionised carbon and neutral oxygen.The detected emission from C+ is consistent with that previously reported beingobserved by the HIFI instrument on Herschel, while the emission from O is hardto explain without assuming a higher-density region in the disk, perhaps in theshape of a clump or a dense torus, required to sufficiently excite the O atoms.A possible scenario is that the C/O gas is produced by the same processresponsible for the CO clump recently observed by ALMA in the disk, and thatthe re-distribution of the gas takes longer than previously assumed. A moredetailed estimate of the C/O ratio and the mass of O will have to await betterconstraints on the C/O gas spatial distribution.

Charged particleswere detected with a particle telescope consisting of 4 annularly segmented Sisurface barrier detectors and $\gamma$ radiation was detected with the FSU$\gamma$ detector array. Five new states were observed below 6 MeV from the$\alpha$-$\gamma$ and $\alpha$-$\gamma$-$\gamma$ coincidence data. Shell modelcalculations suggest that most of the newly observed states are core-excited1p-1h excitations across the $N = Z = 8$ shell gap. Comparisons betweenexperimental data and calculations for the neutron-rich O and F isotopes implya steady reduction of the $p$-$sd$ shell gap as neutrons are added.

Zvyagin;2014/08/06;http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1251v2;The determination of track reconstruction efficiencies at LHCb using$J/\psi\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ decays is presented. Efficiencies above$95\%$ are found for the data taking periods in 2010, 2011, and 2012. The ratioof the track reconstruction efficiency of muons in data and simulation iscompatible with unity and measured with an uncertainty of $0.8\,\%$ for datataking in 2010, and at a precision of $0.4\,\%$ for data taking in 2011 and2012. For hadrons an additional $1.4\,\%$ uncertainty due to materialinteractions is assumed. This result is crucial for accurate cross section andbranching fraction measurements in LHCb.

The combinationof particle and gamma-ray detection with radioactive beams of $^{56}$Ni and$^{52}$Fe, produced by fragmentation at the GANIL/LISE facility, made itpossible to carry out this study for the first time in a closed and anopen-shell nucleus in the \textit{fp}-shell. The transfer cross-sections forground-state to ground-state (J=0$^+$,T=1) and to the first (J=1$^+$,T=0) statewere extracted for both cases together with the transfer cross-section ratios$\sigma$(0$^+$,T=1) /$\sigma$(1$^+$,T=0). They are compared with second-orderdistorted-wave born approximation (DWBA) calculations. The enhancement of theground-state to ground-state pair transfer cross-section close to mid-shell, in$^{52}$Fe, points towards a superfluid phase in the isovector channel. For the""deuteron-like"" transfer, very low cross-sections to the first (J=1$^+$,T=0)state were observed both for \Ni\phe\, and \Fe\phe\, and are related to astrong hindrance of this channel due to spin-orbit effect. No evidence for anisoscalar deuteron-like condensate is observed."

ArXiv;Numerical study of the directed polymer in a 1+3 dimensional random  medium;Cecile Monthus, Thomas Garel;2006/06/06;http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0606132v1;The directed polymer in a 1+3 dimensional random medium is known to present adisorder-induced phase transition. For a polymer of length $L$, the hightemperature phase is characterized by a diffusive behavior for the end-pointdisplacement $R^2 \sim L$ and by free-energy fluctuations of order $\Delta F(L)\sim O(1)$. The low-temperature phase is characterized by an anomalouswandering exponent $R^2/L \sim L^{\omega}$ and by free-energy fluctuations oforder $\Delta F(L) \sim L^{\omega}$ where $\omega \sim 0.18$. In this paper, wefirst study the scaling behavior of various properties to localize the criticaltemperature $T_c$. Our results concerning $R^2/L$ and $\Delta F(L)$ pointtowards $0.76 < T_c \leq T_2=0.79$, so our conclusion is that $T_c$ is equal orvery close to the upper bound $T_2$ derived by Derrida and coworkers ($T_2$corresponds to the temperature above which the ratio$\bar{Z_L^2}/(\bar{Z_L})^2$ remains finite as $L \to \infty$). We then presenthistograms for the free-energy, energy and entropy over disorder samples. For$T \gg T_c$, the free-energy distribution is found to be Gaussian. For $T \llT_c$, the free-energy distribution coincides with the ground state energydistribution, in agreement with the zero-temperature fixed point picture.Moreover the entropy fluctuations are of order $\Delta S \sim L^{1/2}$ andfollow a Gaussian distribution, in agreement with the droplet predictions,where the free-energy term $\Delta F \sim L^{\omega}$ is a near cancellation ofenergy and entropy contributions of order $L^{1/2}$.

In this work we exploitdifferent topologies of coincident events to search for both the neutrinolessand two-neutrino double-decay modes. We find no evidence for either mode andplace lower bounds on the half-lives: $\tau^{0\nu}_{0^+}>7.9\cdot 10^{23}$ yrand $\tau^{2\nu}_{0^+}>2.4\cdot 10^{23}$ yr. Combining our results with thoseobtained by the CUORICINO experiment, we achieve the most stringent constraintsavailable for these processes: $\tau^{0\nu}_{0^+}>1.4\cdot 10^{24}$ yr and$\tau^{2\nu}_{0^+}>2.5\cdot 10^{23}$ yr.

R. van 't Hoff, Catherine Walsh, Suzanne F. Wampfler;2018/05/31;http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12492v1;"Recent measurements carried out at comet 67P/C-G with the ${\it Rosetta}$probe revealed that molecular oxygen, O$_2$, is the fourth most abundantmolecule in comets. Models show that O$_2$ is likely of primordial nature,coming from the interstellar cloud from which our Solar System was formed.However, gaseous O$_2$ is an elusive molecule in the interstellar medium withonly one detection towards quiescent molecular clouds, in the $\rho$ Oph Acore. We perform a deep search for molecular oxygen, through the $2_1 - 0_1$rotational transition at 234 GHz of its $^{16}$O$^{18}$O isotopologue, towardsthe warm compact gas surrounding the nearby Class 0 protostar IRAS 16293--2422B with the ALMA interferometer. The targeted $^{16}$O$^{18}$O transition issurrounded by two brighter transitions at $\pm 1$ km s$^{-1}$ relative to theexpected $^{16}$O$^{18}$O transition frequency. After subtraction of these twotransitions, residual emission at a 3$\sigma$ level remains, but with avelocity offset of $0.3 - 0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ relative to the source velocity,rendering the detection ""tentative"". We derive the O$_2$ column density for twoexcitation temperatures $T_{\rm ex}$ of 125 and 300 K, as indicated by othermolecules, in order to compare the O$_2$ abundance between IRAS16293 and comet67P/C-G. Assuming that $^{16}$O$^{18}$O is not detected and using methanolCH$_3$OH as a reference species, we obtain a [O$_2$]/[CH$_3$OH] abundance ratiolower than $2-5$, depending on the assumed $T_{\rm ex}$, a three to four timeslower abundance than the [O$_2$]/[CH$_3$OH] ratio of $5-15$ found in comet67P/C-G. Such a low O$_2$ abundance could be explained by the lower temperatureof the dense cloud precursor of IRAS16293 with respect to the one at the originof our Solar System that prevented an efficient formation of O$_2$ ininterstellar ices."

Despite the flux of theseparticles being extremely low, the area of ${\sim}\:3{,}000 \: \text{km}^2$covered at the Pierre Auger Observatory, and the 17-year data-taking period ofthe Phase 1 of its operations, have enabled us to measure the arrivaldirections of more than 2,600 ultra-high energy cosmic rays above$32\:\text{EeV}$. We publish this data set, the largest available at suchenergies from an integrated exposure of $122{,}000 \:\text{km}^2\:\text{sr}\:\text{yr}$, and search it for anisotropies over the$3.4\pi$ steradians covered with the Observatory.

We combine the results of the Planck Early Release Compact SourceCatalog (ERCSC) with quasi-simultaneous ground-based observations, as well asarchival data, at frequencies below or overlapping Planck frequency bands, tovalidate the astrometry and photometry of the ERCSC radio sources and study thespectral features shown in this new frequency window opened by Planck. TheERCSC source positions and flux density scales are found to be consistent withthe ground-based observations. We present and discuss the spectral energydistributions (SEDs) of a sample of ""extreme"" radio sources to illustrate therichness of the ERCSC for the study of extragalactic radio sources. Variabilityis found to play a role in the unusual spectral features of some of thesesources."

Astructure at 1.84 GeV/c$^2$ is observed in the $3(\pi^+\pi^-)$ invariant massspectrum with a statistical significance of 7.6$\sigma$ . The mass and widthare measured to be $M=1842.2\pm 4.2^{+7.1}_{-2.6}$ MeV/c$^2$ and $\Gamma=83\pm14 \pm 11$ MeV. The product branching fraction is determined to be$B(J/\psi\rightarrow\gamma X(1840))\times B(X(1840)\rightarrow3(\pi^+\pi^-))=(2.44\pm0.36^{+0.60}_{-0.74})\times 10^{-5}$. No $\eta^\prime$signals are observed in the $3(\pi^+\pi^-)$ invariant mass spectrum, and theupper limit of the branching fraction for the decay $\eta^\prime\rightarrow3(\pi^+\pi^-)$ is set to be $3.1\times10^{-5}$ at a 90% confidence level.

The Born cross section ismeasured to be (62.9\pm 1.9\pm 3.7) pb, consistent with the production of theY(4260). We observe a structure at around 3.9 GeV/c^2 in the \pi^\pm J/psi massspectrum, which we refer to as the Z_c(3900). If interpreted as a new particle,it is unusual in that it carries an electric charge and couples to charmonium.A fit to the \pi^\pm J/psi invariant mass spectrum, neglecting interference,results in a mass of (3899.0\pm 3.6\pm 4.9) MeV/c^2 and a width of (46\pm 10\pm20) MeV. Its production ratio is measured to be R=\frac{\sigma(e+e- to \pi^\pmZ_c(3900)^\mp to pi+pi-J/psi))} {\sigma(e+e- to pi+pi-J/psi)}=(21.5\pm 3.3\pm7.5)%.

Zunica;2021/11/19;http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10194v2;"The photon polarization in $b \to s \gamma$ transitions is measured for thefirst time in radiative b-baryon decays exploiting the unique spin structure of$\Lambda_b \to \Lambda \gamma$ decays. A data sample corresponding to anintegrated luminosity of $6\;fb^{-1}$ collected by the LHCb experiment in $pp$collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $13\;TeV$ is used. The photonpolarization is measured to be $\alpha_{\gamma}=0.82^{\,+\,0.17\,+\,0.04}_{\,-\,0.26\,-\,0.13}$, where the first uncertainty isstatistical and the second systematic. This result is in agreement with theStandard Model prediction and previous measurements in b-meson decays.Charge-parity breaking effects are studied for the first time in thisobservable and found to be consistent with $CP$ symmetry."

T2K observes 15candidate electron antineutrino events with a background expectation of 9.3events. Including information from the kinematic distribution of observedevents, the hypothesis of no electron antineutrino appearance is disfavoredwith a significance of 2.40{\sigma} and no discrepancy between data and PMNSpredictions is found. A complementary analysis that introduces an additionalfree parameter which allows non-PMNS values of electron neutrino andantineutrino appearance also finds no discrepancy between data and PMNSpredictions.

Zvyagin;2014/04/07;http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1903v1;Resonant structures in $B^0\to\psi'\pi^-K^+$ decays are analyzed byperforming a four-dimensional fit of the decay amplitude, using $pp$ collisiondata corresponding to $\rm 3 fb^{-1}$ collected with the LHCb detector. Thedata cannot be described with $K^+\pi^-$ resonances alone, which is confirmedwith a model-independent approach. A highly significant$Z(4430)^-\to\psi'\pi^-$ component is required, thus confirming the existenceof this state. The observed evolution of the $Z(4430)^-$ amplitude with the$\psi'\pi^-$ mass establishes the resonant nature of this particle. The massand width measurements are substantially improved. The spin-parity isdetermined unambiguously to be $1^+$.

We explored the differential cross sections of thereaction $e^+e^- \rightarrow \bar{n}n$ with data collected with the BESIIIdetector at the BEPCII accelerator, corresponding to an integrated luminosityof 354.6 pb$^{-1}$ in total at twelve center-of-mass energies between $\sqrt{s}= 2.0 - 2.95$ GeV. A relative uncertainty of 18% and 12% for the electric andmagnetic form factors, respectively, is achieved at $\sqrt{s} = 2.3935$ GeV.Our results are comparable in accuracy to those from electron scattering in thecomparable space-like (negative $q^2$) region of four-momentum transfer. Theelectromagnetic form factor ratio $R_{\rm em}\equiv |G_E|/|G_M|$ is within theuncertainties close to unity. We compare our result on $|G_E|$ and $|G_M|$ torecent model predictions, and the measurements in the space-like region to testthe analyticity of electromagnetic form factors.

Zucchelli;2018/01/16;http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05403v2;TeO2 bolometers have been used for many years to search for neutrinolessdouble beta decay in 130-Te. CUORE, a tonne-scale TeO2 detector array, recentlypublished the most sensitive limit on the half-life, $T_{1/2}^{0\nu} > 1.5\times 10^{25}\,$yr, which corresponds to an upper bound of $140-400$~meV onthe effective Majorana mass of the neutrino. While it makes CUORE aworld-leading experiment looking for neutrinoless double beta decay, it is notthe only study that CUORE will contribute to in the field of nuclear andparticle physics. As already done over the years with many small-scaleexperiments, CUORE will investigate both rare decays (such as the two-neutrinodouble beta decay of 130-Te and the hypothesized electron capture in 123-Te),and rare processes (e.g., dark matter and axion interactions). This paperdescribes some of the achievements of past experiments that used TeO2bolometers, and perspectives for CUORE.

A search has been performed forhighly-inclined air showers induced by neutrinos of all flavours with nocandidate events found in data taken between 1 Jan 2004 and 31 Aug 2018. Upperlimits on the neutrino flux from point-like steady sources have been derived asa function of source declination. An unrivaled sensitivity is achieved insearches for transient sources with emission lasting over an hour or less, ifthey occur within the field of view corresponding to the zenith angle rangebetween $60^\circ$ and $~95^\circ$ where the SD of the Pierre Auger Observatoryis most sensitive to neutrinos.

Zou;2013/08/13;http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.2760v2;We study the process $e^+e^- \to (D^{*} \bar{D}^{*})^{\pm} \pi^\mp$ at acenter-of-mass energy of 4.26GeV using a 827pb$^{-1}$ data sample obtained withthe BESIII detector at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider. Based on apartial reconstruction technique, the Born cross section is measured to be$(137\pm9\pm15)$pb. We observe a structure near the $(D^{*} \bar{D}^{*})^{\pm}$threshold in the $\pi^\mp$ recoil mass spectrum, which we denote as the$Z^{\pm}_c(4025)$. The measured mass and width of the structure are$(4026.3\pm2.6\pm3.7)$MeV/c$^2$ and $(24.8\pm5.6\pm7.7)$MeV, respectively. Itsproduction ratio $\frac{\sigma(e^+e^-\to Z^{\pm}_c(4025)\pi^\mp \to (D^{*}\bar{D}^{*})^{\pm} \pi^\mp)}{\sigma(e^+e^-\to (D^{*} \bar{D}^{*})^{\pm}\pi^\mp)}$ is determined to be $0.65\pm0.09\pm0.06$. The first uncertaintiesare statistical and the second are systematic.

Zuccarello;2020/07/08;http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04139v2;Extensive air showers, originating from ultra-high energy cosmic rays, havebeen successfully measured through the use of arrays of water-Cherenkovdetectors (WCDs). Sophisticated analyses exploiting WCD data have made itpossible to demonstrate that shower simulations, based on differenthadronic-interaction models, cannot reproduce the observed number of muons atthe ground. The accurate knowledge of the WCD response to muons is paramount inestablishing the exact level of this discrepancy. In this work, we report on astudy of the response of a WCD of the Pierre Auger Observatory to atmosphericmuons performed with a hodoscope made of resistive plate chambers (RPCs),enabling us to select and reconstruct nearly 600 thousand single muontrajectories with zenith angles ranging from 0$^\circ$ to 55$^\circ$.Comparison of distributions of key observables between the hodoscope data andthe predictions of dedicated simulations allows us to demonstrate the accuracyof the latter at a level of 2%. As the WCD calibration is based on its responseto atmospheric muons, the hodoscope data are also exploited to show thelong-term stability of the procedure.

Zuccarello;2020/08/14;http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06486v2;"We report a measurement of the energy spectrum of cosmic rays for energiesabove $2.5 {\times} 10^{18}~$eV based on 215,030 events recorded with zenithangles below $60^\circ$. A key feature of the work is that the estimates of theenergies are independent of assumptions about the unknown hadronic physics orof the primary mass composition. The measurement is the most precise madehitherto with the accumulated exposure being so large that the measurements ofthe flux are dominated by systematic uncertainties except at energies above $5{\times} 10^{19}~$eV. The principal conclusions are: (1) The flattening of thespectrum near $5 {\times} 10^{18}~$eV, the so-called ""ankle"", is confirmed. (2)The steepening of the spectrum at around $5 {\times} 10^{19}~$eV is confirmed.(3) A new feature has been identified in the spectrum: in the region above theankle the spectral index $\gamma$ of the particle flux ($\propto E^{-\gamma}$)changes from $2.51 \pm 0.03~{\rm (stat.)} \pm 0.05~{\rm (sys.)}$ to $3.05 \pm0.05~{\rm (stat.)} \pm 0.10~{\rm (sys.)}$ before changing sharply to $5.1 \pm0.3~{\rm (stat.)} \pm 0.1~{\rm (sys.)}$ above $5 {\times} 10^{19}~$eV. (4) Noevidence for any dependence of the spectrum on declination has been found otherthan a mild excess from the Southern Hemisphere that is consistent with theanisotropy observed above $8 {\times} 10^{18}~$eV."

Ziolkowski, F. Zuccarello;2019/06/18;http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07422v2;Neutrinos with energies above $10^{17}$ eV are detectable with the SurfaceDetector Array of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The identification isefficiently performed for neutrinos of all flavors interacting in theatmosphere at large zenith angles, as well as for Earth-skimming $\tau$neutrinos with nearly tangential trajectories relative to the earth. Noneutrino candidates were found in $\sim\,14.7$ years of data taken up to 31August 2018. This leads to restrictive upper bounds on their flux. The $90\%$C.L. single-flavor limit to the diffuse flux of ultra-high-energy neutrinoswith an $E_\nu^{-2}$ spectrum in the energy range $1.0 \times 10^{17}~{\rm eV}- 2.5 \times 10^{19}~{\rm eV}$ is $E^2 {\rm d}N_\nu/{\rm d}E_\nu < 4.4 \times10^{-9}~{\rm GeV~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}~sr^{-1}}$, placing strong constraints onseveral models of neutrino production at EeV energies and on the properties ofthe sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.

Zvyagin;2014/02/12;http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2982v3;A first study of CP violation in the decay modes $B^\pm\to [K^0_{\rm S} K^\pm\pi^\mp]_D h^\pm$ and $B^\pm\to [K^0_{\rm S} K^\mp \pi^\pm]_D h^\pm$, where $h$labels a $K$ or $\pi$ meson and $D$ labels a $D^0$ or $\overline{D}^0$ meson,is performed. The analysis uses the LHCb data set collected in $pp$ collisions,corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb$^{-1}$. The analysis issensitive to the CP-violating CKM phase $\gamma$ through seven observables: onecharge asymmetry in each of the four modes and three ratios of thecharge-integrated yields. The results are consistent with measurements of$\gamma$ using other decay modes.

Zunica;2021/09/16;http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08084v2;Events containing a $Z$ boson and a charm jet are studied for the first timein the forward region of proton-proton collisions. The data sample usedcorresponds to an integrated luminosity of $6 \, {\rm fb}^{-1}$ collected at acenter-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with the LHCb detector. In events with a $Z$boson and a jet, the fraction of charm jets is determined in intervals of$Z$-boson rapidity in the range $2.0 < y(Z) < 4.5$. A sizable enhancement isobserved in the forward-most $y(Z)$ interval, which could be indicative of avalence-like intrinsic-charm component in the proton wave function.

Zunica;2021/09/02;http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01038v4;Conventional hadronic matter consists of baryons and mesons made of threequarks and quark-antiquark pairs, respectively. The observation of a new typeof hadronic state, a doubly charmed tetraquark containing two charm quarks, ananti-$u$ and an anti-$d$ quark, is reported using data collected by the LHCbexperiment at the Large Hadron Collider. This exotic state with a mass of about3875 MeV$/c^2$ manifests itself as a narrow peak in the mass spectrum of$D^0D^0\pi^+$ mesons just below the $D^{*+}D^0$ mass threshold. The nearthreshold mass together with a strikingly narrow width reveals the resonancenature of the state.

When secondary particles from thecascade arrive at the ground, they are measured by surface detector arrays. Wedescribe the methods applied to the measurements of the surface detector of thePierre Auger Observatory to reconstruct events with zenith angles less than$60^\circ$ using the timing and signal information recorded using thewater-Cherenkov detector stations.

Zunica;2021/12/15;http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08435v2;The identification of charm jets is achieved at LHCb for data collected in2015-2018 using a method based on the properties of displaced verticesreconstructed and matched with jets. The performance of this method isdetermined using a dijet calibration dataset recorded by the LHCb detector andselected such that the jets are unbiased in quantities used in the taggingalgorithm. The charm-tagging efficiency is reported as a function of thetransverse momentum of the jet. The measured efficiencies are compared to thoseobtained from simulation and found to be in good agreement.

Zunica;2021/10/05;http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02350v2;A combination of measurements sensitive to the $CP$ violation angle $\gamma$of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa unitarity triangle and to the charm mixingparameters that describe oscillations between $D^0$ and $\bar{D}^0$ mesons isperformed. Results from the charm and beauty sectors, based on data collectedwith the LHCb detector at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, are combined for thefirst time. This method provides an improvement on the precision of the charmmixing parameter $y$ by a factor of two with respect to the current worldaverage. The charm mixing parameters are determined to be $x =(0.400^{\,+0.052}_{\,-0.053})\%$ and $y = (0.630^{\,+0.033}_{\,-0.030})\%$. Theangle $\gamma$ is found to be $\gamma = (65.4^{\,+3.8}_{\,-4.2})^\circ$ and isthe most precise determination from a single experiment.

Zunica;2021/09/02;http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01056v4;An exotic narrow state in the $D^0D^0\pi^+$ mass spectrum just below the$D^{*+}D^0$ mass threshold is studied using a data set corresponding to anintegrated luminosity of 9 fb$^{-1}$ acquired with the LHCb detector inproton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 7, 8 and 13 TeV. Thestate is consistent with the ground isoscalar $T^+_{cc}$ tetraquark with aquark content of $cc\bar{u}\bar{d}$ and spin-parity quantum numbers$\mathrm{J}^{\mathrm{P}}=1^+$. Study of the $DD$ mass spectra disfavoursinterpretation of the resonance as the isovector state. The decay structure viaintermediate off-shell $D^{*+}$ mesons is confirmed by the $D^0\pi^+$ massdistribution. The mass of the resonance and its coupling to the $D^{*}D$ systemare analysed. Resonance parameters including the pole position, scatteringlength, effective range and compositeness are measured to reveal importantinformation about the nature of the $T^+_{cc}$ state. In addition, anunexpected dependence of the production rate on track multiplicity is observed.

Zendri;2021/07/07;http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03294v3;The three Advanced Virgo and LIGO gravitational wave detectors participatedto the third observing run (O3) between 1 April 2019 15:00 UTC and 27 March2020 17:00 UTC,leading to several gravitational wave detections per month. Thispaper describes the Advanced Virgo detector calibration and the reconstructionof the detector strain $h(t)$ during O3, as well as the estimation of theassociated uncertainties. For the first time, the photon calibration techniqueas been used as reference for Virgo calibration, which allowed tocross-calibrate the strain amplitude of the Virgo and LIGO detectors. Theprevious reference, so-called free swinging Michelson technique, has still beenused but as an independent cross-check. $h(t)$ reconstruction and noisesubtraction were processed online, with good enough quality to prevent the needfor offline reprocessing, except for the two last weeks of September 2019. Theuncertainties for the reconstructed $h(t)$ strain, estimated in this paper in a20-2000~Hz frequency band, are frequency independent: 5% in amplitude, 35 mradin phase and 10 $\mu$s in timing, with the exception of larger uncertaintiesaround 50 Hz.

Zou;2013/09/07;http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1896v2;We study e+e- --> pi+pi-h_c at center-of-mass energies from 3.90 GeV to 4.42GeV using data samples collected with the BESIII detector operating at theBeijing Electron Positron Collider. The Born cross sections are measured at 13energies, and are found to be of the same order of magnitude as those of e+e---> pi+pi-J/psi but with a different line shape. In the \pi^\pm h_c massspectrum, a distinct structure, referred to as Z_c(4020), is observed at 4.02GeV/c^2. The Z_c(4020) carries an electric charge and couples to charmonium. Afit to the \pi^\pm h_c invariant mass spectrum, neglecting possibleinterferences, results in a mass of (4022.9\pm 0.8\pm 2.7) MeV/c^2 and a widthof (7.9\pm 2.7\pm 2.6) MeV for the Z_c(4020), where the first errors arestatistical and the second systematic. No significant Z_c(3900) signal isobserved, and upper limits on the Z_c(3900) production cross sections in\pi^\pm h_c at center-of-mass energies of 4.23 and 4.26 GeV are set.

Zvyagin;2014/02/25;http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6242v3;The LHCb measurement of the lifetime ratio of the $\Lambda^0_b$ to the$\overline{B}^0$ meson is updated using data corresponding to an integratedluminosity of 3.0 fb$^{-1}$ collected using 7 and 8 TeV centre-of-mass energy$pp$ collisions at the LHC. The decay modes used are $\overline{B}^0\to J/\psip K^-$ and $\overline{B}^0\to J/\psi \pi^+ K^-$, where the $\pi^+K^-$ mass isconsistent with that of the $\overline{K}^{*0}(892)$ meson. The lifetime ratiois determined with unprecedented precision to be $0.974\pm0.006\pm0.004$, wherethe first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. This result isin agreement with original theoretical predictions based on the heavy quarkexpansion. Using the current world average of the $\overline{B}^0$ lifetime,the $\Lambda^0_b$ lifetime is found to be $1.479 \pm 0.009 \pm 0.010$ ps.

Zu;2022/11/23;http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12699v1;We search for an axion-like particle (ALP) $a$ through the process$\psi(3686)\rightarrow\pi^+\pi^-J/\psi$, $J/\psi\rightarrow\gamma a$,$a\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$ in a data sample with $(2708.1\pm14.5)\times10^6$$\psi(3686)$ events collected by the BESIII detector. No significant ALP signalis observed over the expected background, and the upper limits on the branchingfraction of the decay $J/\psi\rightarrow\gamma a$ and the ALP-photon couplingconstant $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ are set at the 95\% confidence level in the massrange of $0.165\leq m_a\leq2.84\,\mbox{GeV}/c^2$. The limits on$\mathcal{B}(J/\psi\rightarrow\gamma a)$ range from $8.3\times10^{-8}$ to$1.8\times10^{-6}$ over the search region, and the constraints on theALP-photon coupling are the most stringent to date for $0.165\leqm_a\leq1.468\,\mbox{GeV}/c^2$.

Zunica;2021/09/06;http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02621v2;A study of $\Lambda_b^0$ baryon decays to the $DpK^-$ final state ispresented based on a proton-proton collision data sample corresponding to anintegrated luminosity of 9 fb$^{-1}$ collected with the LHCb detector. Two$\Lambda_b^0$ decays are considered, $\Lambda_b^0\to DpK^-$ with $D\toK^-\pi^+$ and $D\to K^+\pi^-$, where $D$ represents a superposition of $D^0$and $\overline{D}^0$ states. The latter process is expected to be suppressedrelative to the former, and is observed for the first time. The ratio ofbranching fractions of the two decays is measured, and the $C\!P$ asymmetry ofthe suppressed mode, which is sensitive to the CKM angle $\gamma$, is alsoreported.

Zunica;2021/10/14;http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07293v3;A search is performed for massive long-lived particles (LLP) decayingsemileptonically into a muon and two quarks. Two kinds of LLP productionprocesses were considered. In the first, a Higgs-like boson with mass from 30to 200 GeV is produced by gluon fusion and decays into two LLPs. The analysiscovers LLP mass values from 10 GeV up to about one half the Higgs-like bosonmass. The second LLP production mode is directly from quark interactions, withLLP masses from 10 to 90 GeV. The LLP lifetimes considered range from 5 to 200ps. This study uses LHCb data collected from proton-proton collisions atsqrt(s)=13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.4 1/fb. Noevidence of these long-lived states has been observed, and upper limits on theproduction cross-section times branching ratio have been set for each modelconsidered.

Zunica;2021/09/15;http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07360v2;The production cross-section of the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ state relative to the$\psi(2S)$ meson is measured using proton-proton collision data collected withthe LHCb experiment at centre-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s}=8$ and 13 TeV,corresponding to integrated luminosities of 2.0 and 5.4 fb$^{-1}$,respectively. The two mesons are reconstructed in the $J/\psi\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$final state. The ratios of the prompt and nonprompt $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ to$\psi(2S)$ production cross-sections are measured as a function of transversemomentum, $p_{\rm T}$, and rapidity, $y$, in the kinematic range $4 < p_{\rm T}< 20$ GeV/$c$ and $2.0 < y < 4.5$. The prompt ratio is found to increase with$p_{\rm T}$ independently of $y$. The double-differential cross-section ratioof $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ relative to $\psi(2S)$ mesons between 13 and 8 TeV is alsomeasured for the prompt component and observed to be consistent with unity,independent of $p_{\rm T}$ and centre-of-mass energy.

Zvyagin;2014/05/16;http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4140v1;The mixing-induced CP-violating phase $\phi_s$ in ${B}^0_s$ and$\overline{B}^0_s$ decays is measured using the $J/\psi \pi^+\pi^-$ final statein data, taken from 3\,fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity, collected with theLHCb detector in 7 and 8 TeV centre-of-mass $pp$ collisions at the LHC. Atime-dependent flavour-tagged amplitude analysis, allowing for direct \CPviolation, yields a value for the phase $\phi_s=70\pm 68\pm 8$\,mrad. Thisresult is consistent with the Standard Model expectation and previousmeasurements.

Its science goals are to measure the CMB polarization signalsoriginating from both primordial gravitational waves and weak lensing. PB-2 isdesigned to measure the tensor to scalar ratio, r, with precision {\sigma}(r) <0.01, and the sum of neutrino masses, {\Sigma}m{\nu}, with{\sigma}({\Sigma}m{\nu}) < 90 meV. To achieve these goals, PB-2 will employ7588 transition-edge sensor bolometers at 95 GHz and 150 GHz, which will beoperated at the base temperature of 250 mK. Science observations will begin in2017.

Zu";2022/12/10;http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05296v1;The first direct measurement of the absolute branching fraction of $\Sigma^+\to \Lambda e^+ \nu_{e}$ is reported based on an $e^+e^-$ annihilation sampleof $(10087\pm44) \times 10^6$ $J/\psi$ events collected with the BESIIIdetector at $\sqrt{s}=3.097$ GeV. The branching fraction is determined to be${\mathcal B}(\Sigma^+ \to \Lambda e^+ \nu_{e}) = [2.93\pm0.74(\rm stat) \pm0.13(\rm syst)]\times 10^{-5}$, which is the most precise measurement obtainedin a single experiment to date and also the first result obtained at a colliderexperiment. Combining this result with the world average of ${\mathcalB}(\Sigma^- \to \Lambda e^- \bar{\nu}_{e})$ and the lifetimes of$\Sigma^{\pm}$, the ratio, $\frac{\Gamma(\Sigma^- \to \Lambda e^-\bar{\nu}_{e})}{\Gamma(\Sigma^+ \to \Lambda e^+ \nu_{e})}$, is determined to be$1.06 \pm 0.28$, which is within 1.8 standard deviations of the value expectedin the absence of second-class currents that are forbidden in the StandardModel.

Zvyagin;2014/02/25;http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6248v1;The resonant structure of the decay $\overline{B}_s^0\to J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ isstudied using data corresponding to 3 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity from$pp$ collisions by the LHC and collected by the LHCb detector. Five interfering$\pi^+\pi^-$ states are required to describe the decay:$f_0(980),f_0(1500),f_0(1790),f_2(1270)$, and $f_2^{\prime}(1525)$. Analternative model including these states and a non-resonant $J/\psi \pi^+\pi^-$component also provides a good description of the data. Based on the differenttransversity components measured for the spin-2 intermediate states, the finalstate is found to be compatible with being entirely $CP$-odd. The $CP$-evenpart is found to be $<2.3$% at 95% confidence level. The $f_0(500)$ state isnot observed, allowing a limit to be set on the absolute value of the mixingangle with the $f_0(980)$ of $<7.7^{\circ}$ at 90% confidence level, consistentwith a tetraquark interpretation of the $f_0(980)$ substructure.

Zunica;2021/11/05;http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03327v2;The first full angular analysis and an updated measurement of the decay-rate$CP$ asymmetry of the $D^0 \to \pi^+\pi^-\mu^+\mu^-$ and $D^0 \toK^+K^-\mu^+\mu^-$ decays are reported. The analysis uses proton-protoncollision data collected with the LHCb detector at centre-of-mass energies of7, 8 and 13 TeV. The data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 9fb$^{-1}$. The full set of $CP$-averaged angular observables and their $CP$asymmetries are measured as a function of the dimuon invariant mass. Theresults are consistent with expectations from the standard model and with $CP$symmetry.

Zunica;2021/10/09;http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04497v2;Two narrow resonant states are observed in the ${\it\Lambda}_b^0 K^-\pi^+$mass spectrum using a data sample of proton-proton collisions at acenter-of-mass energy of 13$~\rm TeV$, collected by the LHCb experiment andcorresponding to an integrated luminosity of $6~{\rm fb}^{-1}$. The minimalquark content of the ${\it\Lambda}_b^0 K^-\pi^+$ system indicates that theseare excited ${\it\Xi}_b^0$ baryons. The masses of the ${\it\Xi}_b(6327)^0$ and${\it\Xi}_b(6333)^0$ states are $m({\it\Xi}_b(6327)^0) = 6327.28^{\,+\,0.23}_{\,-\,0.21} \pm 0.12 \pm 0.24~{\rm MeV}$ and$m({\it\Xi}_b(6333)^0) = 6332.69 ^{\,+\,0.17}_{\,-\,0.18} \pm 0.03 \pm0.22~{\rm MeV}$, respectively, with a mass splitting of $\Delta m = 5.41^{\,+\,0.26}_{\,-\,0.27} \pm 0.12 ~{\rm MeV}$, where the uncertainties arestatistical, systematic and due to the ${\it\Lambda}_b^0$ mass measurement. Themeasured natural widths of these states are consistent with zero, with upperlimits of $\Gamma({\it\Xi}_b(6327)^0)<2.20~(2.56) ~{\rm MeV}$ and$\Gamma({\it\Xi}_b(6333)^0)<1.60~(1.92) ~{\rm MeV}$ at a $90\%~(95\%)$credibility level. The significance of the two-peak hypothesis is larger thannine (five) Gaussian standard deviations compared to the no-peak (one-peak)hypothesis. The masses, widths and resonant structure of the new states are ingood agreement with the expectations for a doublet of 1$D$ ${\it\Xi}_b^0$resonances.

Zunica;2021/09/02;http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01113v2;The $W$ boson mass is measured using proton-proton collision data at$\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.7 fb$^{-1}$recorded during 2016 by the LHCb experiment. With a simultaneous fit of themuon $q/p_T$ distribution of a sample of $W \to \mu\nu$ decays and the $\phi^*$distribution of a sample of $Z\to\mu\mu$ decays the $W$ boson mass isdetermined to be \begin{equation*} m_{W} = 80354 \pm 23_{\rm stat} \pm 10_{\rmexp} \pm 17_{\rm theory} \pm 9_{\rm PDF}~\mathrm{MeV}, \end{equation*} whereuncertainties correspond to contributions from statistical, experimentalsystematic, theoretical and parton distribution function sources. This is anaverage of results based on three recent global parton distribution functionsets. The measurement agrees well with the prediction of the global electroweakfit and with previous measurements.

Zunica;2021/09/15;http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07292v2;A search for the doubly charmed baryon $\it{\Xi}_{cc}^{+}$ is performed inthe $\it{\Xi}_{c}^{+} \pi^{-} \pi^{+}$ invariant-mass spectrum, where the$\it{\Xi}_{c}^{+}$ baryon is reconstructed in the $p K^{-} \pi^{+}$ finalstate. The study uses proton-proton collision data collected with the LHCbdetector at a centre-of-mass energy of 13$\mathrm{\,Te\kern -0.1em V}$,corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 5.4$\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. Nosignificant signal is observed in the invariant-mass range of3.4$-$3.8$\mathrm{\,Ge\kern -0.1em V}/c^2$. Upper limits are set on the ratioof branching fractions multiplied by the production cross-section with respectto the $\it{\Xi}_{cc}^{++} \rightarrow (\it{\Xi}_{c}^{+} \rightarrow p K^{-}\pi^{+}) \pi^{+}$ decay for different $\it{\Xi}_{cc}^{+}$ mass and lifetimehypotheses in the rapidity range from 2.0 to 4.5 and the transverse momentumrange from 2.5 to 25$\mathrm{\,Ge\kern -0.1em V}/c$. The results from thissearch are combined with a previously published search for the$\it{\Xi}_{cc}^{+} \rightarrow \it{\Lambda}_{c}^{+} K^{-} \pi^{+}$ decay mode,yielding a maximum local significance of 4.0 standard deviations around themass of 3620$\mathrm{\,Me\kern -0.1em V}/c^2$, including systematicuncertainties. Taking into account the look-elsewhere effect in the3.5$-$3.7$\mathrm{\,Ge\kern -0.1em V}/c^2$ mass window, the combined globalsignificance is 2.9 standard deviations including systematic uncertainties.

The cross-sections are measureddifferentially as a function of transverse momentum, $p_{\text{T}}$, andrapidity, $y$, and separately for $J/\psi$ mesons produced promptly and frombeauty hadron decays (nonprompt). With the assumption of unpolarised $J/\psi$mesons, the production cross-sections integrated over the kinematic range$0<p_{\text{T}}<20~\text{GeV}/c$ and $2.0<y<4.5$ are$8.154\pm0.010\pm0.283~\mu\text{b}$ for prompt $J/\psi$ mesons and$0.820\pm0.003\pm0.034~\mu\text{b}$ for nonprompt $J/\psi$ mesons, where thefirst uncertainties are statistical and the second systematic. Thesecross-sections are compared with those at $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV and $13$ TeV, andare used to update the measurement of the nuclear modification factor inproton-lead collisions for $J/\psi$ mesons at a centre-of-mass energy pernucleon pair of $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}}=5$ TeV.

Zunica;2021/09/03;http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01334v2;A measurement of the lifetimes of the $\Omega^{0}_{c}$ and $\Xi^{0}_{c}$baryons is reported using proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-massenergy of $13\text{ TeV}$, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of$5.4\text{ fb}^{-1}$ collected by the LHCb experiment. The $\Omega^{0}_{c}$ and$\Xi^{0}_{c}$ baryons are produced directly from proton interactions andreconstructed in the $pK^{-}K^{-}\pi^{+}$ final state. The $\Omega^{0}_{c}$lifetime is measured to be $276.5\pm13.4\pm4.4\pm0.7\text{ fs}$, and the$\Xi^{0}_{c}$ lifetime is measured to be $148.0\pm2.3\pm2.2\pm0.2\text{ fs}$,where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second systematic, and thethird due to the uncertainty on the $D^{0}$ lifetime. These results confirmprevious LHCb measurements based on semileptonic beauty-hadron decays, whichdisagree with earlier results of a four times shorter $\Omega^{0}_{c}$lifetime, and provide the single most precise measurement of the$\Omega^{0}_{c}$ lifetime.

Zucchelli, D. Zuliani, G. Zunica;2021/09/01;http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00488v2;A data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $9 \text{fb}^{-1}$ ofproton-proton collisions collected by the LHCb experiment has been analysed tosearch for $B_c^+ \to D^{(*)+}_{(s)} \overset{\scriptstyle (-)}{D}{}^{(*)0}$decays. The decays are fully or partially reconstructed, where one or twomissing neutral pions or photons from the decay of an excited charm meson areallowed. Upper limits for the branching fractions, normalised to $B^+$ decaysto final states with similar topologies, are obtained for fourteen $B_c^+$decay modes. For the decay $B_c^+ \to D_s^+ {\overline{D}}^0$, an excess with asignificance of 3.4 standard deviations is found.

We found a background rate ranging from 25 cpd/keV/kg at 3keV to 2 cpd/keV/kg at 25 keV, and a peak at 4.7 keV. The origin of this peakis presently unknown, but its presence is confirmed by a reanalysis of 62.7kg.days of data from the finished CUORICINO experiment. Finally, we report theexpected sensitivities of the CUORE0 (52 bolometers) and CUORE (988 bolometers)experiments to a WIMP annual modulation signal.

Urban;2018/07/09;http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03275v2;In August 2017, Advanced Virgo joined Advanced LIGO for the end of the O2run, leading to the first gravitational waves detections with thethree-detector network. This paper describes the Advanced Virgo calibration andthe gravitational wave strain h(t) reconstruction during O2. The methods arethe same as the ones developed for the initial Virgo detector and have alreadybeen described in previous publications, this paper summarizes the differencesand emphasis is put on estimating systematic uncertainties. Three versions ofthe h(t) signal have been computed for the Virgo O2 run, an online version andtwo post-run reprocessed versions with improved detector calibration andreconstruction algorithm. A photon calibrator has been used to establish thesign of h(t) and to make an independent partial cross-check of the systematicuncertainties. The uncertainties reached for the latest h(t) version are 5.1%in amplitude, 40 mrad in phase and 20 microseconds in timing.

Usingthe~decay $\Lambda_b^0\rightarrow \Lambda_c^+ \pi^+ \pi^-\pi^-$ as anormalisation channel, the ratio of branching fractions is measured to be $$\frac { {\mathcal{B}} ( \Lambda_b^0\rightarrow D^+ p \pi^-\pi^- ) }  { {\mathcal{B}} ( \Lambda_b^0\rightarrow \Lambda_c^+ \pi^+ \pi^-\pi^- ) }  \times  \frac { {\mathcal{B}} ( D^+ \rightarrow K^-\pi^+\pi^+) }  { {\mathcal{B}} ( \Lambda_c^+ \rightarrow p K^-\pi^+ ) }  = ( 5.35 \pm 0.21 \pm 0.16 ) \% \,, $$ where the first uncertainty isstatistical and the second systematic. The ratio of branching fractions for$\Lambda_b^0\rightarrow D^{*+} p \pi^-\pi^-$ and $\Lambda_b^0\rightarrow D^+ p\pi^-\pi^-$ decays is found to be $$ \frac{ {\mathcal{B}} (\Lambda_b^0\rightarrow D^{*+} p \pi^-\pi^- )}  { {\mathcal{B}} ( \Lambda_b^0\rightarrow D^{+} p \pi^-\pi^- )}  \times  (  {\mathcal{B}}( D^{*+} \rightarrow \pi^0 ) +  {\mathcal{B}}( D^{*+} \rightarrow \gamma ))  = ( 61.3 \pm 4.3 \pm 4.0 ) \% \,. $$

Zuccarello;2018/08/10;http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03579v2;We present a detailed study of the large-scale anisotropies of cosmic rayswith energies above 4 EeV measured using the Pierre Auger Observatory. For theenergy bins [4,8] EeV and $E\geq 8$ EeV, the most significant signal is adipolar modulation in right ascension at energies above 8 EeV, as previouslyreported. In this paper we further scrutinize the highest-energy bin bysplitting it into three energy ranges. We find that the amplitude of the dipoleincreases with energy above 4 EeV. The growth can be fitted with a power lawwith index $\beta=0.79\pm 0.19$. The directions of the dipoles are consistentwith an extragalactic origin of these anisotropies at all the energiesconsidered. Additionally we have estimated the quadrupolar components of theanisotropy: they are not statistically significant. We discuss the results inthe context of the predictions from different models for the distribution ofultrahigh-energy sources and cosmic magnetic fields.

Zunica;2021/10/18;http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09501v3;Tests of lepton universality in $B^0\to K^0_S \ell^+ \ell^-$ and $B^+\toK^{*+} \ell^+ \ell^-$ decays where $\ell$ is either an electron or a muon arepresented. The differential branching fractions of $B^0\to K^0_S e^+ e^-$ and$B^+\to K^{*+} e^+ e^-$ decays are measured in intervals of the dileptoninvariant mass squared. The measurements are performed using proton-protoncollision data recorded by the LHCb experiment, corresponding to an integratedluminosity of $9\, \mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. The results are consistent with theStandard Model and previous tests of lepton universality in related decaymodes. The first observation of $B^0 \to K^0_S e^+ e^-$ and $B^+ \to K^{*+} e^+e^-$ decays is reported.

Zunica;2021/12/14;http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07458v3;A precision measurement of the $Z$ boson production cross-section at$\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV in the forward region is presented, using $pp$ collisiondata collected by the LHCb detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosityof 5.1 fb$^{-1}$. The production cross-section is measured using$Z\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$ events within the fiducial region defined aspseudorapidity $2.0<\eta<4.5$ and transverse momentum $p_{T}>20$ GeV/$c$ forboth muons and dimuon invariant mass $60<M_{\mu\mu}<120$ GeV/$c^2$. Theintegrated cross-section is determined to be \begin{equation*}\sigma(Z\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-) = 196.4 \pm 0.2 \pm 1.6 \pm 3.9~pb,\end{equation*} where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second issystematic, and the third is due to the luminosity determination. The measuredresults are in agreement with theoretical predictions within uncertainties.

Zehrer;2022/09/13;http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05926v1;We use the surface detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory to search for airshowers initiated by photons with an energy above $10^{19}$ eV. Photons in thezenith angle range from 30$^\circ$ to 60$^\circ$ can be identified in theoverwhelming background of showers initiated by charged cosmic rays through thebroader time structure of the signals induced in the water-Cherenkov detectorsof the array and the steeper lateral distribution of shower particles reachingground. Applying the search method to data collected between January 2004 andJune 2020, upper limits at 95\% CL are set to an $E^{-2}$ diffuse flux ofultra-high energy photons above $10^{19}$ eV, $2{\times}10^{19}$ eV and$4{\times}10^{19}$ eV amounting to $2.11{\times}10^{-3}$, $3.12{\times}10^{-4}$and $1.72{\times}10^{-4}$ km$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. Whilethe sensitivity of the present search around $2 \times 10^{19}$ eV approachesexpectations of cosmogenic photon fluxes in the case of a pure-protoncomposition, it is one order of magnitude above those from more realisticmixed-composition models. The inferred limits have also implications for thesearch of super-heavy dark matter that are discussed and illustrated.

ArXiv;First spectrally-resolved H$_2$ observations towards HH 54 / Low H$_2$O  abundance in shocks;G. Santangelo, S. Antoniucci, B. Nisini, C. Codella, P. Bjerkeli, T. Giannini, A. Lorenzani, L. K. Lundin, S. Cabrit, L. Calzoletti, R. Liseau, D. Neufeld, M. Tafalla, E. F. van Dishoeck;2014/09/09;http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2779v1;Context: Herschel observations suggest that the H$_2$O distribution inoutflows from low-mass stars resembles the H$_2$ emission. It is still unclearwhich of the different excitation components that characterise the mid- andnear-IR H$_2$ distribution is associated with H$_2$O. Aim: The aim is tospectrally resolve the different excitation components observed in the H$_2$emission. This will allow us to identify the H$_2$ counterpart associated withH$_2$O and finally derive directly an H$_2$O abundance estimate with respect toH$_2$. Methods: We present new high spectral resolution observations of H$_2$0-0 S(4), 0-0 S(9), and 1-0 S(1) towards HH 54, a bright nearby shock region inthe southern sky. In addition, new Herschel-HIFI H$_2$O (2$_{12}$$-$1$_{01}$)observations at 1670~GHz are presented. Results: Our observations show for thefirst time a clear separation in velocity of the different H$_2$ lines: the 0-0S(4) line at the lowest excitation peaks at $-$7~km~s$^{-1}$, while the moreexcited 0-0 S(9) and 1-0 S(1) lines peak at $-$15~km~s$^{-1}$. H$_2$O andhigh-$J$ CO appear to be associated with the H$_2$ 0-0 S(4) emission, whichtraces a gas component with a temperature of 700$-$1000 K. The H$_2$O abundancewith respect to H$_2$ 0-0 S(4) is estimated to be$X$(H$_2$O)$<$1.4$\times$10$^{-5}$ in the shocked gas over an area of13$^{\prime\prime}$. Conclusions: We resolve two distinct gas componentsassociated with the HH 54 shock region at different velocities and excitations.This allows us to constrain the temperature of the H$_2$O emitting gas($\leq$1000 K) and to derive correct estimates of H$_2$O abundance in theshocked gas, which is lower than what is expected from shock model predictions.

Zunica;2021/11/04;http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03001v1;Using proton-proton collision data, corresponding to an integrated luminosityof $9fb^{-1}$ collected with the LHCb detector, seven decay modes of the$B_c^+$ meson into a $J/\psi$ or $\psi(2S)$ meson and three charged hadrons,kaons or pions, are studied. The decays $B_c^+\rightarrow ( \psi(2S)\rightarrow J/\psi \pi^+ \pi^-)\pi^+ $, $B_c^+\rightarrow\psi(2S)\pi^+\pi^+\pi^-$, $B_c^+\rightarrow J/\psi K^+\pi^+\pi^-$ and$B_c^+\rightarrow K^+K^+K^-$ are observed for the first time, and evidence forthe $B_c^+\rightarrow \psi(2S)K^+K^-\pi^+$ decay is found, where $J/\psi$ and$\psi(2S)$ mesons are reconstructed in their dimuon decay modes. The ratios ofbranching fractions between the different $B_c^+$ decays are reported as wellas the fractions of the decays proceeding via intermediate resonances. Theresults largely support the factorisation approach used for a theoreticaldescription of the studied decays.
ArXiv;Low-temperature thermal conductivity and magnetic transitions of the  kagomé-staircase compound Ni$_3$V$_2$O$_8$;Z. Y. Zhao, Q. J. Li, X. G. Liu, X. Rao, H. L. Che, L. G. Chu, Z. Z. He, X. Zhao, X. F. Sun;2019/06/17;http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06833v1;Kagom\'{e}-staircase compound Ni$_3$V$_2$O$_8$ is an attractive multiferroicmaterial exhibiting rich phase diagrams. However, the magnetic properties andmagnetic transitions have been studied only above 1.3 K. In this work, we studythe thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) of Ni$_3$V$_2$O$_8$ single crystals at lowtemperatures down to 0.3 K and in magnetic fields up to 14 T. In zero field,the magnetic transitions from the low-temperature incommensurate (LTI) phase tothe commensurate phase (C) and then to a second commensurate phase (C') yieldanomalies in $\kappa(T)$ curves at $T\rm_{LC}$ = 3.7 K and $T\rm_{CC'}$ = 2.0K, respectively, which indicates a significant phonon scattering by thecritical spin fluctuations. When the field is applied along the $a$ axis, thefield dependence of $\kappa$ displays four anomalies associated with differentmagnetic transitions and reveals an undetected magnetic state at subKelvintemperatures. In addition, the $\kappa(B)$ curves are found to depend not onlyon the history but also on the magnitude of applying field. When the field isapplied along the $b$ axis, a high-field phase locating above the LTI andhigh-temperature incommensurate (HTI) phases is revealed.

Ward;2018/02/17;http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06184v1;We present a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) survey of extended [O III]{\lambda}5007 emission for a sample of 12 nearby (z < 0.12), luminous Type 2quasars (QSO2s), which we use to measure the extent and kinematics of theirAGN-ionized gas. We find the size of the observed [O III] regions scale withluminosity in comparison to nearby, less luminous Seyfert galaxies and radiallyoutflowing kinematics to exist in all targets. We report an average maximumoutflow radius of $\sim$600 pc, with gas continuing to be kinematicallyinfluenced by the central AGN out to an average radius of $\sim$1130 pc. Thesefindings question the effectiveness of AGN being capable of clearing materialfrom their host bulge in the nearby universe and suggest that disruption of gasby AGN activity may prevent star formation without requiring evacuation.Additionally, we find a dichotomy in our targets when comparing [O III] radialextent and nuclear FWHM, where QSO2s with compact [O III] morphologiestypically possess broader nuclear emission-lines.

Zweizig;2020/10/27;http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14529v2;"Gravitational waves enable tests of general relativity in the highlydynamical and strong-field regime. Using events detected by LIGO-Virgo up to 1October 2019, we evaluate the consistency of the data with predictions from thetheory. We first establish that residuals from the best-fit waveform areconsistent with detector noise, and that the low- and high-frequency parts ofthe signals are in agreement. We then consider parametrized modifications tothe waveform by varying post-Newtonian and phenomenological coefficients,improving past constraints by factors of ${\sim}2$; we also find consistencywith Kerr black holes when we specifically target signatures of thespin-induced quadrupole moment. Looking for gravitational-wave dispersion, wetighten constraints on Lorentz-violating coefficients by a factor of${\sim}2.6$ and bound the mass of the graviton to $m_g \leq 1.76 \times10^{-23} \mathrm{eV}/c^2$ with 90% credibility. We also analyze the propertiesof the merger remnants by measuring ringdown frequencies and damping times,constraining fractional deviations away from the Kerr frequency to $\delta\hat{f}_{220} = 0.03^{+0.38}_{-0.35}$ for the fundamental quadrupolar mode, and$\delta \hat{f}_{221} = 0.04^{+0.27}_{-0.32}$ for the first overtone;additionally, we find no evidence for postmerger echoes. Finally, we determinethat our data are consistent with tensorial polarizations through atemplate-independent method. When possible, we assess the validity of generalrelativity based on collections of events analyzed jointly. We find no evidencefor new physics beyond general relativity, for black hole mimickers, or for anyunaccounted systematics."

Zunica;2021/08/17;http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07678v2;The first search for the rare radiative decay $\Xi_b^- \to \Xi^- \gamma$ isperformed using data collected by the LHCb experiment in proton-protoncollisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integratedluminosity of 5.4 fb$^{-1}$. The $\Xi_b- \to \Xi^- J/\psi$ channel is used asnormalization. No $\Xi_b^- \to \Xi^- \gamma$ signal is found and an upper limitof $\mathcal{B}(\Xi_b^- \to \Xi^- \gamma) < 1.3 \times 10^{-4}$ at 95%confidence level is obtained.

The results obtainedin this calibration measurement represent a major commissioning milestone forthe upcoming direct neutrino mass measurement with KATRIN. The successfulcampaign demonstrates the functionalities of the full KATRIN beamline. TheKATRIN main spectrometer's excellent energy resolution of ~ 1 eV made itpossible to determine the narrow K-32 and L$_3$-32 conversion electron linewidths with an unprecedented precision of ~ 1 %.

With the help of extensive detector simulations done with IQMDtransport model events including nuclear clusters, various nuisance effectsinfluencing the observed proton cumulants have been investigated. Acceptanceand efficiency corrections have been applied as a function of fine grainedrapidity and transverse momentum bins, as well as considering local trackdensity dependencies. Next, the effects of volume changes within particularcentrality selections have been considered and beyond-leading-order correctionshave been applied to the data. The efficiency and volume corrected protonnumber moments and cumulants Kn of orders n = 1, . . . , 4 have been obtainedas a function of centrality and phase-space bin, as well as the correspondingcorrelators C_n . We find that the observed correlators show a power-lawscaling with the mean number of protons, i.e. $C_n \propto <N>^n$, indicativeof mostly long-range multi-particle correlations in momentum space. We alsopresent a comparison of our results with Au+Au collision data obtained at RHICat similar centralities, but higher $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$.

The experimental correlation functions allow the determination ofthe space-time extent of the corresponding emission sources via a comparison tomodels. The emission source, parametrized as three-dimensional Gaussiandistribution, is studied in dependence on pair transverse momentum, azimuthalemission angle with respect to the reaction plane, collision centrality andbeam energy. For all centralities and transverse momenta, a geometricaldistribution of ellipsoidal shape is found in the plane perpendicular to thebeam direction with the larger extension perpendicular to the reaction plane.For large transverse momenta, the corresponding eccentricity approaches theinitial eccentricity. The eccentricity is smallest for most central collisions,where the shape is almost circular. The magnitude of the tilt angle of theemission ellipsoid in the reaction plane decreases with increasing centralityand increasing transverse momentum. All source radii increase with centrality,largely exhibiting a linear rise with the number of participants, irrespectiveof transverse momentum. A substantial charge-sign difference of the sourceradii is found, appearing most pronounced at low transverse momentum. Theextracted source parameters are consistent with the extrapolation of theirenergy dependence down from higher energies.

Pion multiplicity per participating nucleondecreases moderately with increasing centrality. The polar angulardistributions are found to be non-isotropic even for the most central eventclass. Our results on pion multiplicity fit well into the general trend of theworld data, but undershoot by $2.5 \sigma$ data from the FOPI experimentmeasured at slightly lower beam energy.

Vaknin;2010/07/13;http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.2197v1;Elastic neutron scattering studies of an optimized LaFeAsO single crystalreveal that upon cooling, an onset of the tetragonal (T)-to-orthorhombic (O)structural transition occurs at $T_\texttt{S} \approx 156$ K, and it exhibits asharp transition at $T_\texttt{P} \approx 148$ K. We argue that in thetemperature range $T_\texttt{S}$ to $T_\texttt{P}$, T and O structures maydynamically coexist possibly due to nematic spin correlations recently proposedfor the iron pnictides, and we attribute $T_\texttt{P}$ to the formation oflong-range O domains from the finite local precursors. The antiferromagneticstructure emerges at $T_\texttt{N} \approx 140$ K, with the iron momentdirection along the O \emph{a} axis. We extract the iron magnetic form factorand use the tabulated $\langle j_0\rangle$ of Fe, Fe$^{2+}$ and Fe$^{3+}$ toobtain a magnetic moment size of $\sim$0.8 $\mu_\texttt{B}$ at 9.5 K.

We give an overview of the maineffects and of the tools and methods applied to assess residuals in maps andpower spectra. We also present an overall budget of known systematic effectuncertainties, which are dominated sidelobe straylight pick-up and imperfectcalibration. However, even these two effects are at least two orders ofmagnitude weaker than the cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations asmeasured in terms of the angular temperature power spectrum. A residual signalabove the noise level is present in the multipole range $\ell<20$, most notablyat 30 GHz, and is likely caused by residual Galactic straylight contamination.Current analysis aims to further reduce the level of spurious signals in thedata and to improve the systematic effects modelling, in particular withrespect to straylight and calibration uncertainties.

The sample spansapproximately a decade in total mass, 10^14 < M_500 < 10^15, where M_500 is themass corresponding to a total density contrast of 500. Combining these highquality Planck measurements with deep XMM-Newton X-ray data, we investigate therelations between D_A^2 Y_500, the integrated Compton parameter due to the SZeffect, and the X-ray-derived gas mass M_g,500, temperature T_X, luminosityL_X, SZ signal analogue Y_X,500 = M_g,500 * T_X, and total mass M_500. Aftercorrection for the effect of selection bias on the scaling relations, we findresults that are in excellent agreement with both X-ray predictions andrecently-published ground-based data derived from smaller samples. The presentdata yield an exceptionally robust, high-quality local reference, andillustrate Planck's unique capabilities for all-sky statistical studies ofgalaxy clusters.

Initiated in 2008 and completed in 2013, the project was supportedby 3 Large Program allocations, as well as various programs initiated byindependent PIs and archival resources. Ultimately, over 4800 circularlypolarized spectra of 560 O and B stars were collected with the instrumentsESPaDOnS at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, Narval at the T\'elescopeBernard Lyot, and HARPSpol at the European Southern Observatory La Silla 3.6mtelescope, making MiMeS by far the largest systematic investigation of massivestar magnetism ever undertaken. In this paper, the first in a series reportingthe general results of the survey, we introduce the scientific motivation andgoals, describe the sample of targets, review the instrumentation andobservational techniques used, explain the exposure time calculation designedto provide sensitivity to surface dipole fields above approximately 100 G,discuss the polarimetric performance, stability and uncertainty of theinstrumentation, and summarize the previous and forthcoming publications.

Zeller;2022/02/09;http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04587v1;We report on the direct cosmic relic neutrino background search from thefirst two science runs of the KATRIN experiment in 2019. Beta-decay electronsfrom a high-purity molecular tritium gas source are analyzed by ahigh-resolution MAC-E filter around the kinematic endpoint at 18.57 keV. Theanalysis is sensitive to a local relic neutrino overdensity of 9.7e10 (1.1e11)at a 90% (95%) confidence level. A fit of the integrated electron spectrum overa narrow interval around the kinematic endpoint accounting for relic neutrinocaptures in the Tritium source reveals no significant overdensity. This workimproves the results obtained by the previous kinematic neutrino massexperiments at Los Alamos and Troitsk. We furthermore update the projectedfinal sensitivity of the KATRIN experiment to <1e10 at 90% confidence level, byrelying on updated operational conditions.

An inflection of the spectrum is observed, confirming the presence ofthe so-called \emph{second-knee} feature. The spectrum is then combined withthat of the 1500\,m array to produce a single measurement of the flux, linkingthis spectral feature with the three additional breaks at the highest energies.The combined spectrum, with an energy scale set calorimetrically viafluorescence telescopes and using a single detector type, results in the moststatistically and systematically precise measurement of spectral breaks yetobtained.

Zacchei, A. Zonca;2011/06/07;http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1376v3;We present first results on PLCK G266.6-27.3, a galaxy cluster candidatedetected at a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 in the Planck All Sky survey. AnXMM-Newton validation observation has allowed us to confirm that the candidateis a bona fide galaxy cluster. With these X-ray data we measure an accurateredshift, z = 0.94 +/- 0.02, and estimate the cluster mass to be M_500 = (7.8+/- 0.8)e+14 solar masses. PLCK G266.6-27.3 is an exceptional system: itsluminosity of L_X(0.5-2.0 keV)=(1.4 +/- 0.05)e+45 erg/s, equals that of the twomost luminous known clusters in the z > 0.5 universe, and it is one of the mostmassive clusters at z~1. Moreover, unlike the majority of high-redshiftclusters, PLCK G266.6-27.3 appears to be highly relaxed. This observationconfirms Planck's capability of detecting high-redshift, high-mass clusters,and opens the way to the systematic study of population evolution in theexponential tail of the mass function.

Weltevrede;2020/07/28;http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14251v2;We present a search for continuous gravitational waves from five radiopulsars, comprising three recycled pulsars (PSR J0437-4715, PSR J0711-6830, andPSR J0737-3039A) and two young pulsars: the Crab pulsar (J0534+2200) and theVela pulsar (J0835-4510). We use data from the third observing run of AdvancedLIGO and Virgo combined with data from their first and second observing runs.For the first time we are able to match (for PSR J0437-4715) or surpass (forPSR J0711-6830) the indirect limits on gravitational-wave emission fromrecycled pulsars inferred from their observed spin-downs, and constrain theirequatorial ellipticities to be less than $10^{-8}$. For each of the fivepulsars, we perform targeted searches that assume a tight coupling between thegravitational-wave and electromagnetic signal phase evolution. We also presentconstraints on PSR J0711-6830, the Crab pulsar and the Vela pulsar from asearch that relaxes this assumption, allowing the gravitational-wave signal tovary from the electromagnetic expectation within a narrow band of frequenciesand frequency derivatives.

Zou;2013/07/04;http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1189v1;Based on $(106.41 \pm 0.86)\times 10^{6}$ $\psi(3686)$ events collected withthe BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider, the branching fractions of$\psi(3686) \to \pi^+\pi^- J/\psi$, $J/\psi \to e^+e^- $, and $J/\psi \to\mu^+\mu^-$ are measured. We obtain ${\cal B}[\psi(3686) \to\pi^+\pi^-J/\psi]=(34.98\pm 0.02\pm 0.45)%$, ${\cal B}[J/\psi \to e^+e^-] =(5.983 \pm 0.007 \pm 0.037)%$ and ${\cal B}[J/\psi \to \mu^+\mu^-] = (5.973 \pm0.007 \pm 0.038)%$. The measurement of ${\cal B}[\psi(3686) \to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}J/\psi]$ confirms the CLEO-c measurement, and is apparentlylarger than the others. The measured $J/\psi$ leptonic decay branchingfractions agree with previous experiments within one standard deviation. Theseresults lead to ${\cal B}[J/\psi \to l^+l^-] = (5.978 \pm 0.005 \pm 0.040)%$ byaveraging over the $e^{+}e^{-}$ and $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ channels and a ratio of${\cal B}[J/\psi \to e^+e^-] / {\cal B}[J/\psi \to \mu^+\mu^-] = 1.0017 \pm0.0017 \pm 0.0033$, which tests $e$-$\mu$ universality at the four tenths of apercent level. All the measurements presented in this paper are the mostprecise in the world to date.

Zundel;2014/09/10;http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3128v1;Spherical harmonic moments are well-suited for capturing anisotropy at anyscale in the flux of cosmic rays. An unambiguous measurement of the full set ofspherical harmonic coefficients requires full-sky coverage. This can beachieved by combining data from observatories located in both the northern andsouthern hemispheres. To this end, a joint analysis using data recorded at theTelescope Array and the Pierre Auger Observatory above $10^{19}$ eV ispresented in this work. The resulting multipolar expansion of the flux ofcosmic rays allows us to perform a series of anisotropy searches, and inparticular to report on the angular power spectrum of cosmic rays above$10^{19}$ eV. No significant deviation from isotropic expectations is foundthroughout the analyses performed. Upper limits on the amplitudes of the dipoleand quadrupole moments are derived as a function of the direction in the sky,varying between 7% and 13% for the dipole and between 7% and 10% for asymmetric quadrupole.

The neutral$D$ meson decay is reconstructed in the three-body final states:$K^\pm\pi^\mp\pi^0$}; $\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$; $K^+K^-\pi^0$ and the suppressed$\pi^\pm K^\mp\pi^0$ combination. The mode where a large $CP$ asymmetry isexpected, $B^\pm\to [\pi^\pm K^\mp\pi^0]_DK^\pm$, is observed with asignificance greater than seven standard deviations. The ratio of the partialwidth of this mode relative to that of the favoured mode, $B^\pm\to[K^\pm\pi^\mp\pi^0]_D K^\pm$, is $R_{{\rm ADS}(K)} = (1.27\pm0.16\pm0.02)\times10^{-2}$. Evidence for a large $CP$ asymmetry is also seen: $A_{{\rm ADS}(K)} =-0.38\pm0.12\pm0.02$. Constraints on the CKM angle $\gamma$ are calculated fromthe eleven reported observables."

Zucchelli;2018/08/30;http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10342v1;CUORE is a 741 kg array of 988 TeO$_2$ bolometeric crystals designed tosearch for the neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{130}$Te and other rareprocesses. CUORE has been taking data since summer 2017, and as of summer 2018collected a total of 86.3 kg$\cdot$yr of TeO$_2$ exposure. Based on thisexposure, we were able to set a limit on the $0\nu\beta\beta$ half-life of$^{130}$Te of $T^{0\nu}_{1/2}>1.5\times10^{25}$ yr at 90% C.L. At thisconference, we showed the decomposition of the CUORE background and were ableto extract a $^{130}$Te $2\nu\beta\beta$ half-life of$T_{1/2}^{2\nu}=[7.9\pm0.1 \mathrm{(stat.)}\pm0.2\mathrm{(syst.)}]\times10^{20}$ yr. This is the most precise measurement ofthis half-life and is consistent with previous measurements.

The single-surveyPlanck data confirm that the flattest high-frequency radio spectral indices areclose to zero, indicating that the original accelerated electron energyspectrum is much harder than commonly thought, with power-law index around 1.5instead of the canonical 2.5. The radio spectra peak at high frequencies andexhibit a variety of shapes. For a small set of low-z sources, we find aspectral upturn at high frequencies, indicating the presence of intrinsic colddust. Variability can generally be approximated by achromatic variations, whilesources with clear signatures of evolving shocks appear to be limited to thestrongest outbursts.

Zuccarello;2020/02/14;http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06172v1;We present measurements of the large-scale cosmic-ray anisotropies in rightascension, using data collected by the surface detector array of the PierreAuger Observatory over more than 14 years. We determine the equatorial dipolecomponent, $\vec{d}_\perp$, through a Fourier analysis in right ascension thatincludes weights for each event so as to account for the main detector-inducedsystematic effects. For the energies at which the trigger efficiency of thearray is small, the ``East-West'' method is employed. Besides using the datafrom the array with detectors separated by 1500 m, we also include data fromthe smaller but denser sub-array of detectors with 750 m separation, whichallows us to extend the analysis down to $\sim 0.03$ EeV. The most significantequatorial dipole amplitude obtained is that in the cumulative bin above 8~EeV,$d_\perp=6.0^{+1.0}_{-0.9}$%, which is inconsistent with isotropy at the6$\sigma$ level. In the bins below 8 EeV, we obtain 99% CL upper-bounds on$d_\perp$ at the level of 1 to 3 percent. At energies below 1 EeV, even thoughthe amplitudes are not significant, the phases determined in most of the binsare not far from the right ascension of the Galactic center, at $\alpha_{\rmGC}=-94^\circ$, suggesting a predominantly Galactic origin for anisotropies atthese energies. The reconstructed dipole phases in the energy bins above 4 EeVpoint instead to right ascensions that are almost opposite to the Galacticcenter one, indicative of an extragalactic cosmic ray origin.

Zucchelli;2014/04/17;http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.4469v1;Neutrinoless double beta decay (0nubb) is one of the most sensitive probesfor physics beyond the Standard Model, providing unique information on thenature of neutrinos. In this paper we review the status and outlook forbolometric 0nubb decay searches. We summarize recent advances in backgroundsuppression demonstrated using bolometers with simultaneous readout of heat andlight signals. We simulate several configurations of a future CUORE-likebolometer array which would utilize these improvements and present thesensitivity reach of a hypothetical next-generation bolometric 0nubbexperiment. We demonstrate that a bolometric experiment with the isotope massof about 1 ton is capable of reaching the sensitivity to the effective Majorananeutrino mass (|mee|) of order 10-20 meV, thus completely exploring theso-called inverted neutrino mass hierarchy region. We highlight the mainchallenges and identify priorities for an R&D program addressing them.

Zunica;2022/01/10;http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03497v3;The first observation of the semileptonic $b$-baryon decay $ \Lambda_b^0\rightarrow \Lambda_c^+ \tau^-\overline{\nu}_{\tau}$, with a significance of$6.1\,\sigma$, is reported using a data sample corresponding to 3 fb$^{-1}$ ofintegrated luminosity, collected by the LHCb experiment at centre-of-massenergies of 7 and 8 TeV at the LHC. The $\tau^-$ lepton is reconstructed in thehadronic decay to three charged pions. The branching fraction${\mathcal{B}}(\Lambda_b^0 \rightarrow \Lambda_c^+\tau^-\overline{\nu}_{\tau})= (1.50 \pm 0.16\pm 0.25\pm 0.23)\%$ is obtained, where uncertainties arestatistical, systematic and from the external branching fraction of thenormalisation channel $\Lambda_b^0\rightarrow \Lambda_c^+\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$. Theratio of semileptonic branching fractions ${\mathcal{R}}( \Lambda_c^+)\equiv{\mathcal{B}}( \Lambda_b^0 \rightarrow \Lambda_c^+\tau^-\overline{\nu}_{\tau})/{\mathcal{B}}( \Lambda_b^0 \rightarrow \Lambda_c^+\mu^-\overline{\nu}_{\mu})$ is derived to be $0.242 \pm 0.026 \pm 0.040\pm0.059$, where the external branching fraction uncertainty from the channel$\Lambda_b^0\rightarrow \Lambda_c^+\mu^-\overline{\nu}_{\mu}$ contributes tothe last term. This result is in agreement with the Standard Model prediction.

The energy analysis of the decay electrons is achieved by a MAC-Efilter spectrometer. A common background source in this setup is the decay ofshort-lived isotopes, such as $\textsuperscript{219}$Rn and$\textsuperscript{220}$Rn, in the spectrometer volume. Active and passivecountermeasures have been implemented and tested at the KATRIN mainspectrometer. One of these is the magnetic pulse method, which employs theexisting air coil system to reduce the magnetic guiding field in thespectrometer on a short timescale in order to remove low- and high-energystored electrons. Here we describe the working principle of this method andpresent results from commissioning measurements at the main spectrometer.Simulations with the particle-tracking software Kassiopeia were carried out togain a detailed understanding of the electron storage conditions and removalprocesses.

Zunica;2022/02/18;http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09106v2;A measurement of the ratios of the effective decay widths of $D^0 \to\pi^-\pi^+$ and $D^0 \to K^-K^+$ decays over that of $D^0 \to K^-\pi^+$ decaysis performed with the LHCb experiment using proton-proton collisions at acentre-of-mass energy of $13 \, \mathrm{TeV}$, corresponding to an integratedluminosity of $6 \, \mathrm{fb^{-1}}$. These observables give access to thecharm mixing parameters $y_{CP}^{\pi\pi} - y_{CP}^{K\pi}$ and $y_{CP}^{KK} -y_{CP}^{K\pi}$, and are measured as $y_{CP}^{\pi\pi} - y_{CP}^{K\pi} = (6.57\pm 0.53 \pm 0.16) \times 10^{-3}$, $y_{CP}^{KK} - y_{CP}^{K\pi} = (7.08 \pm0.30 \pm 0.14) \times 10^{-3}$, where the first uncertainties are statisticaland the second systematic. The combination of the two measurements is $y_{CP} -y_{CP}^{K\pi} = (6.96 \pm 0.26 \pm 0.13) \times 10^{-3}$, which is four timesmore precise than the previous world average.

Zunica;2022/03/03;http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01602v2;The first study of the angular distribution of $\mu^+ \mu^-$ pairs producedin the forward rapidity region via the Drell-Yan reaction $pp \rightarrow\gamma^{*}/Z +X \rightarrow l^+ l^- + X$ is presented, using data collectedwith the LHCb detector at a centre-of-mass energy of 13TeV, corresponding to anintegrated luminosity of 5.1 $\rm{fb}^{-1}$. The coefficients of the fiveleading terms in the angular distribution are determined as a function of thedimuon transverse momentum and rapidity. The results are compared to varioustheoretical predictions of the $Z$-boson production mechanism and can also beused to probe transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions within theproton.

Zunica;2022/01/25;http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10167v2;A search for the decay $B^0\to\phi\mu^+\mu^-$ is performed usingproton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 7, 8, and 13 TeVcollected by the LHCb experiment and corresponding to an integrated luminosityof 9 fb$^{-1}$. No evidence for the $B^0\to \phi \mu^+ \mu^-$ decay is foundand an upper limit on the branching fraction, excluding the $\phi$ andcharmonium regions in the dimuon spectrum, of $4.4 \times 10^{-3}$ at a 90$\%$credibility level, relative to that of the $B^0_s \to \phi \mu^+ \mu^-$ decay,is established. Using the measured $B^0_s\to\phi\mu^+\mu^-$ branching fractionand assuming a phase-space model, the absolute branching fraction of the decay$B^0\to \phi \mu^+ \mu^-$ in the full $q^2$ range is determined to be less than$3.2 \times 10^{-9}$ at a 90$\%$ credibility level.

Zunica;2021/12/21;http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11428v2;The first observations of$B^0\rightarrow\overline{D}^{*}(2007)^{0}K^{+}\pi^{-}$ and$B_s^0\rightarrow\overline{D}^{*}(2007)^{0}K^{-}\pi^{+}$ decays are presented,and their branching fractions relative to that of the$B^0\rightarrow\overline{D}^{*}(2007)^{0}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ decay are reported.These modes can potentially be used to investigate the spectroscopy of charmand charm-strange resonances and to determine the angle $\gamma$ of the CKMunitarity triangle. It is also important to understand them as a source ofpotential background in determinations of $\gamma$ from $B^{+}\rightarrowDK^{+}$ and $B^{0}\rightarrow DK^{+}\pi^{-}$ decays. The analysis is based on asample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $5.4 ~\rm{fb}^{-1}$ ofproton--proton collision data at $13 ~\rm{TeV}$ centre-of-mass energy recordedwith the LHCb detector. The $\overline{D}^{*}(2007)^{0}$ mesons are fullyreconstructed in the $\overline{D}^{0}\pi^{0}$ and $\overline{D}^{0}\gamma$channels, with the $\overline{D}^{0} \rightarrow K^{+}\pi^{-}$ decay. A novelweighting method is used to subtract background while simultaneously applyingan event-by-event efficiency correction to account for resonant structures inthe decays.

Zucchelli;2014/07/04;http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.1094v1;The CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events) experiment willsearch for neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{130}$Te. With 741 kg of TeO$_2$crystals and an excellent energy resolution of 5 keV (0.2%) at the region ofinterest, CUORE will be one of the most competitive neutrinoless double betadecay experiments on the horizon. With five years of live time, CUORE projectedneutrinoless double beta decay half-life sensitivity is $1.6\times 10^{26}$ yat $1\sigma$ ($9.5\times10^{25}$ y at the 90% confidence level), whichcorresponds to an upper limit on the effective Majorana mass in the range40--100 meV (50--130 meV). Further background rejection with auxiliary lightdetector can significantly improve the search sensitivity and competitivenessof bolometric detectors to fully explore the inverted neutrino mass hierarchywith $^{130}$Te and possibly other double beta decay candidate nuclei.

Weltevrede";2017/01/26;http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07709v5;We present the result of searches for gravitational waves from 200 pulsarsusing data from the first observing run of the Advanced LIGO detectors. We findno significant evidence for a gravitational-wave signal from any of thesepulsars, but we are able to set the most constraining upper limits yet on theirgravitational-wave amplitudes and ellipticities. For eight of these pulsars,our upper limits give bounds that are improvements over the indirect spin-downlimit values. For another 32, we are within a factor of 10 of the spin-downlimit, and it is likely that some of these will be reachable in future runs ofthe advanced detector. Taken as a whole, these new results improve on previouslimits by more than a factor of two.

The detectors are 5x5x5 cm3 crystals operated at about 10 mK in afacility used to test bolometers for the CUORE experiment at the LaboratoriNazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy. An analysis of 43.65 kg d of data was madeusing a newly developed low energy trigger which was optimized to reduce thedetectors energy threshold. An upper limit of 0.63 c kg-1 d-1 was establishedat 95% C.L.. From this value, a lower bound at 95% C.L. was placed on thePeccei-Quinn energy scale of fa >= 0.76 10**6 GeV for a value of S=0.55 for theflavor-singlet axial vector matrix element. Bounds are given for the interval0.15 < S < 0.55.

Serra-Ricart;2017/10/16;http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05835v1;"The detection of GW170817 in both gravitational waves and electromagneticwaves heralds the age of gravitational-wave multi-messenger astronomy. On 17August 2017 the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors observed GW170817, a strongsignal from the merger of a binary neutron-star system. Less than 2 secondsafter the merger, a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) was detected within a regionof the sky consistent with the LIGO-Virgo-derived location of thegravitational-wave source. This sky region was subsequently observed by opticalastronomy facilities, resulting in the identification of an optical transientsignal within $\sim 10$ arcsec of the galaxy NGC 4993. These multi-messengerobservations allow us to use GW170817 as a standard siren, thegravitational-wave analog of an astronomical standard candle, to measure theHubble constant. This quantity, which represents the local expansion rate ofthe Universe, sets the overall scale of the Universe and is of fundamentalimportance to cosmology. Our measurement combines the distance to the sourceinferred purely from the gravitational-wave signal with the recession velocityinferred from measurements of the redshift using electromagnetic data. Thisapproach does not require any form of cosmic ""distance ladder;"" thegravitational wave analysis can be used to estimate the luminosity distance outto cosmological scales directly, without the use of intermediate astronomicaldistance measurements. We determine the Hubble constant to be$70.0^{+12.0}_{-8.0} \, \mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$(maximum a posteriori and 68% credible interval). This is consistent withexisting measurements, while being completely independent of them. Additionalstandard-siren measurements from future gravitational-wave sources will provideprecision constraints of this important cosmological parameter."

Zonca;2015/12/09;http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02882v2;The secondary cosmic microwave background (CMB) $B$-modes stem from thepost-decoupling distortion of the polarization $E$-modes due to thegravitational lensing effect of large-scale structures. These lensing-induced$B$-modes constitute both a valuable probe of the dark matter distribution andan important contaminant for the extraction of the primary CMB $B$-modes frominflation. Planck provides accurate nearly all-sky measurements of both thepolarization $E$-modes and the integrated mass distribution via thereconstruction of the CMB lensing potential. By combining these two dataproducts, we have produced an all-sky template map of the lensing-induced$B$-modes using a real-space algorithm that minimizes the impact of sky masks.The cross-correlation of this template with an observed (primordial andsecondary) $B$-mode map can be used to measure the lensing $B$-mode powerspectrum at multipoles up to $2000$. In particular, when cross-correlating withthe $B$-mode contribution directly derived from the Planck polarization maps,we obtain lensing-induced $B$-mode power spectrum measurement at a significancelevel of $12\,\sigma$, which agrees with the theoretical expectation derivedfrom the Planck best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model. This unique nearly all-skysecondary $B$-mode template, which includes the lensing-induced informationfrom intermediate to small ($10\lesssim \ell\lesssim 1000$) angular scales, isdelivered as part of the Planck 2015 public data release. It will beparticularly useful for experiments searching for primordial $B$-modes, such asBICEP2/Keck Array or LiteBIRD, since it will enable an estimate to be made ofthe lensing-induced contribution to the measured total CMB $B$-modes.

Zinatulina;2022/03/14;http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07361v1;Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) is a process inwhich neutrinos scatter on a nucleus which acts as a single particle. Thoughthe total cross section is large by neutrino standards, CE$\nu$NS has longproven difficult to detect, since the deposited energy into the nucleus is$\sim$ keV. In 2017, the COHERENT collaboration announced the detection ofCE$\nu$NS using a stopped-pion source with CsI detectors, followed up thedetection of CE$\nu$NS using an Ar target. The detection of CE$\nu$NS hasspawned a flurry of activities in high-energy physics, inspiring newconstraints on beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics, and new experimentalmethods. The CE$\nu$NS process has important implications for not onlyhigh-energy physics, but also astrophysics, nuclear physics, and beyond.

Varela;2021/01/27;http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11747v3;The Auger Muon Infill Ground Array (AMIGA) is part of the AugerPrime upgradeof the Pierre Auger Observatory. It consists of particle counters buried 2.3 munderground next to the water-Cherenkov stations that form the 23.5 km$^2$large infilled array. The reduced distance between detectors in this denserarea allows the lowering of the energy threshold for primary cosmic rayreconstruction down to about 10$^{17}$ eV. At the depth of 2.3 m theelectromagnetic component of cosmic ray showers is almost entirely absorbed sothat the buried scintillators provide an independent and direct measurement ofthe air showers muon content. This work describes the design and implementationof the AMIGA embedded system, which provides centralized control, dataacquisition and environment monitoring to its detectors. The presented systemwas firstly tested in the engineering array phase ended in 2017, and latelyselected as the final design to be installed in all new detectors of theproduction phase. The system was proven to be robust and reliable and hasworked in a stable manner since its first deployment.

Zadoroghny;2018/02/14;http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05227v2;The neutrino mass experiment KATRIN requires a stability of 3 ppm for theretarding potential at -18.6 kV of the main spectrometer. To monitor thestability, two custom-made ultra-precise high-voltage dividers were developedand built in cooperation with the German national metrology institutePhysikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB). Until now, regular absolutecalibration of the voltage dividers required bringing the equipment to thespecialised metrology laboratory. Here we present a new method based onmeasuring the energy difference of two $^{83\mathrm{m}}$Kr conversion electronlines with the KATRIN setup, which was demonstrated during KATRIN'scommissioning measurements in July 2017. The measured scale factor$M=1972.449(10)$ of the high-voltage divider K35 is in agreement with the lastPTB calibration four years ago. This result demonstrates the utility of thecalibration method, as well as the long-term stability of the voltage divider.

Zonca;2011/01/11;http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.2044v2;The data reported in Planck's Early Release Compact Source Catalogue (ERCSC)are exploited to measure the number counts (dN/dS) of extragalactic radiosources at 30, 44, 70, 100, 143 and 217 GHz. Due to the full-sky nature of thecatalogue, this measurement extends to the rarest and brightest sources in thesky. At lower frequencies (30, 44, and 70 GHz) our counts are in very goodagreement with estimates based on WMAP data, being somewhat deeper at 30 and 70GHz, and somewhat shallower at 44 GHz. Planck's source counts at 143 and 217GHz join smoothly with the fainter ones provided by the SPT and ACT surveysover small fractions of the sky. An analysis of source spectra, exploitingPlanck's uniquely broad spectral coverage, finds clear evidence of a steepeningof the mean spectral index above about 70 GHz. This implies that, at thesefrequencies, the contamination of the CMB power spectrum by radio sources belowthe detection limit is significantly lower than previously estimated.

The measurements are performedusing proton-proton collision data, corresponding to an integrated luminosityof $1.6\text{fb}^{-1}$, collected by the LHCb experiment in 2016. No evidenceis observed for the 25 decay modes that are investigated and $90\%$ confidencelevel limits on the branching fractions are set between $1.4\times10^{-8}$ and$6.4\times10^{-6}$. In most cases, these results represent an improvement onexisting limits by one to two orders of magnitude.

Zuzel;2017/07/28;http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09279v3;We present the first simultaneous measurement of the interaction rates of$pp$, $^7$Be, and $pep$ solar neutrinos performed with a global fit to theBorexino data in an extended energy range (0.19-2.93)$\,$MeV. This result wasobtained by analyzing 1291.51$\,$days of Borexino Phase-II data, collectedbetween December 2011 and May 2016 after an extensive scintillator purificationcampaign. We find:rate($pp$)$\,$=$\,$$134$$\,$$\pm$$\,$$10$$\,$($stat$)$\,$$^{\rm +6}_{\rm-10}$$\,$($sys$)$\,$cpd/100$\,$t,rate($^7$Be)$\,$=$\,$$48.3$$\,$$\pm$$\,$$1.1$$\,$($stat$)$\,$$^{\rm +0.4}_{\rm-0.7}$$\,$($sys$)$\,$cpd/100$\,$t, andrate($pep$)$\,$=$\,$$2.43$$\pm$$\,$$0.36$$\,$($stat$)$^{+0.15}_{-0.22}$$\,$($sys$)$\,$cpd/100$\,$t.These numbers are in agreement with and improve the precision of our previousmeasurements. In particular, the interaction rate of $^7$Be $\nu$'s is measuredwith an unprecedented precision of 2.7%, showing that discriminating betweenthe high and low metallicity solar models is now largely dominated bytheoretical uncertainties. The absence of $pep$ neutrinos is rejected for thefirst time at more than 5$\,$$\sigma$. An upper limit of $8.1$$\,$cpd/100$\,$t(95%$\,$C.L.) on the CNO neutrino rate is obtained by setting an additionalconstraint on the ratio between the $pp$ and $pep$ neutrino rates in the fit.This limit has the same significance as that obtained by the Borexino Phase-I(currently providing the tightest bound on this component), but is obtained byapplying a less stringent constraint on the $pep$ $\nu$ flux.

Zunica;2020/11/27;http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13738v2;The $\varLambda^0_b \to \varLambda^+_c K^+ K^- \pi^-$ decay is observed forthe first time using a data sample of proton-proton collisions atcentre-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s}=7$ and 8 $\rm{TeV}$ collected by the$\mbox{LHCb}$ detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of$3{\rm{fb}^{-1}}$. The ratio of branching fractions between the $\varLambda^0_b\to \varLambda^+_c K^+ K^- \pi^-$ and the$\varLambda^{0}_{b}\to\varLambda^{+}_{c}D^{-}_{s}$ decays is measured to be\begin{equation*} \frac{\mathcal{B} ( \varLambda^0_b \to \varLambda^+_c K^+ K^-\pi^-) } {\mathcal{B} ( \varLambda^0_b \to \varLambda^+_c D^-_s)} = (9.26 \pm0.29 \pm 0.46 \pm 0.26)\times10^{-2}, \end{equation*} where the firstuncertainty is statistical, the second systematic and the third is due to theknowledge of the $D^-_s \to K^+ K^- \pi^-$ branching fraction. No structure onthe invariant mass distribution of the $\varLambda^+_c K^+$ system is found,consistent with no open-charm pentaquark signature.

Zunica;2020/10/19;http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09437v2;The inclusive $b \bar{b}$- and $c \bar{c}$-dijet production cross-sections inthe forward region of $pp$ collisions are measured using a data samplecollected with the LHCb detector at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV in 2016.The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 1.6 fb$^{-1}$.Differential cross-sections are measured as a function of the transversemomentum and of the pseudorapidity of the leading jet, of the rapiditydifference between the jets, and of the dijet invariant mass. A fiducial regionfor the measurement is defined by requiring that the two jets originating fromthe two $b$ or $c$ quarks are emitted with transverse momentum greater than 20GeV$/c$, pseudorapidity in the range $2.2 < \eta < 4.2$, and with a differencein the azimuthal angle between the two jets greater than 1.5. The integrated $b\bar{b}$-dijet cross-section is measured to be $53.0 \pm 9.7$ nb, and the total$c \bar{c}$-dijet cross-section is measured to be $73 \pm 16$ nb. The ratiobetween $c \bar{c}$- and $b \bar{b}$-dijet cross-sections is also measured andfound to be $1.37 \pm 0.27$. The results are in agreement with theoreticalpredictions at next-to-leading order.

Its main goal is toinvestigate this decay in $^{130}$Te, but its ton-scale mass and low backgroundmake CUORE sensitive to other rare processes as well. In this work, we presentour first results on the search for \nbb decay of $^{128}$Te, the Te isotopewith the second highest natural isotopic abundance. We find no evidence forthis decay, and using a Bayesian analysis we set a lower limit on the$^{128}$Te \nbb decay half-life of T$_{1/2} > 3.6 \times 10^{24}$ yr (90\% CI).This represents the most stringent limit on the half-life of this isotope,improving by over a factor 30 the previous direct search results, and exceedingthose from geochemical experiments for the first time.

Dinucleon decay isa process that violates baryon number by two units. We present the first searchfor dinucleon decay to pions in a large water Cherenkov detector. The modes$^{16}$O$(pp) \rightarrow$ $^{14}$C$\pi^{+}\pi^{+}$, $^{16}$O$(pn) \rightarrow$$^{14}$N$\pi^{+}\pi^{0}$, and $^{16}$O$(nn) \rightarrow$$^{14}$O$\pi^{0}\pi^{0}$ are investigated. No significant excess in theSuper-Kamiokande data has been found, so a lower limit on the lifetime of theprocess per oxygen nucleus is determined. These limits are:$\tau_{pp\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{+}} > 7.22 \times 10^{31}$ years,$\tau_{pn\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{0}} > 1.70 \times 10^{32}$ years, and$\tau_{nn\rightarrow\pi^{0}\pi^{0}} > 4.04 \times 10^{32}$ years. The lowerlimits on each mode are about two orders of magnitude better than previouslimits from searches for dinucleon decay in iron.

We apply two different methods. One is a search for sets of eventsthat show a correlation between their arrival direction and the inverse oftheir energy, which would be expected if they come from the same point-likesource, they have the same electric charge and their deflection is relativelysmall and coherent. We refer to these sets of events as ""multiplets"". Thesecond method, called ""thrust"", is a principal axis analysis aimed to detectthe elongated patterns in a region of interest. We study the sensitivity ofboth methods using a benchmark simulation and we apply them to data in twodifferent searches. The first search is done assuming as source candidates alist of nearby active galactic nuclei and starburst galaxies. The second is anall-sky blind search. We report the results and we find no statisticallysignificant features. We discuss the compatibility of these results with theindications on the mass composition inferred from data of the Pierre AugerObservatory."

Zepeda;2021/03/22;http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11983v2;The Pierre Auger Observatory, at present the largest cosmic-ray observatoryever built, is instrumented with a ground array of 1600 water-Cherenkovdetectors, known as the Surface Detector (SD). The SD samples the secondaryparticle content (mostly photons, electrons, positrons and muons) of extensiveair showers initiated by cosmic rays with energies ranging from $10^{17}~$eV upto more than $10^{20}~$eV. Measuring the independent contribution of the muoncomponent to the total registered signal is crucial to enhance the capabilityof the Observatory to estimate the mass of the cosmic rays on an event-by-eventbasis. However, with the current design of the SD, it is difficult tostraightforwardly separate the contributions of muons to the SD time tracesfrom those of photons, electrons and positrons. In this paper, we present amethod aimed at extracting the muon component of the time traces registeredwith each individual detector of the SD using Recurrent Neural Networks. Wederive the performances of the method by training the neural network onsimulations, in which the muon and the electromagnetic components of the tracesare known. We conclude this work showing the performance of this method onexperimental data of the Pierre Auger Observatory. We find that our predictionsagree with the parameterizations obtained by the AGASA collaboration todescribe the lateral distributions of the electromagnetic and muonic componentsof extensive air showers.

Zepeda;2020/12/15;http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08016v2;To obtain direct measurements of the muon content of extensive air showerswith energy above $10^{16.5}$ eV, the Pierre Auger Observatory is currentlybeing equipped with an underground muon detector (UMD), consisting of 219 10$\mathrm{m^2}$-modules, each segmented into 64 scintillators coupled to siliconphotomultipliers (SiPMs). Direct access to the shower muon content allows forthe study of both of the composition of primary cosmic rays and of high-energyhadronic interactions in the forward direction. As the muon density can varybetween tens of muons per m$^2$ close to the intersection of the shower axiswith the ground to much less than one per m$^2$ when far away, the necessarybroad dynamic range is achieved by the simultaneous implementation of twoacquisition modes in the read-out electronics: the binary mode, tuned to countsingle muons, and the ADC mode, suited to measure a high number of them. Inthis work, we present the end-to-end calibration of the muon detector modules:first, the SiPMs are calibrated by means of the binary channel, and then, theADC channel is calibrated using atmospheric muons, detected in parallel to theshower data acquisition. The laboratory and field measurements performed todevelop the implementation of the full calibration chain of both binary and ADCchannels are presented and discussed. The calibration procedure is reliable towork with the high amount of channels in the UMD, which will be operatedcontinuously, in changing environmental conditions, for several years.

Zepeda;2021/01/08;http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02946v2;The atmospheric depth of the air shower maximum $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ is anobservable commonly used for the determination of the nuclear mass compositionof ultra-high energy cosmic rays. Direct measurements of $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ areperformed using observations of the longitudinal shower development withfluorescence telescopes. At the same time, several methods have been proposedfor an indirect estimation of $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ from the characteristics ofthe shower particles registered with surface detector arrays. In this paper, wepresent a deep neural network (DNN) for the estimation of $X_{\mathrm{max}}$.The reconstruction relies on the signals induced by shower particles in theground based water-Cherenkov detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory. Thenetwork architecture features recurrent long short-term memory layers toprocess the temporal structure of signals and hexagonal convolutions to exploitthe symmetry of the surface detector array. We evaluate the performance of thenetwork using air showers simulated with three different hadronic interactionmodels. Thereafter, we account for long-term detector effects and calibrate thereconstructed $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ using fluorescence measurements. Finally, weshow that the event-by-event resolution in the reconstruction of the showermaximum improves with increasing shower energy and reaches less than$25~\mathrm{g/cm^{2}}$ at energies above $2\times 10^{19}~\mathrm{eV}$.

Zunica;2020/07/14;http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06945v2;A study of prompt charm-hadron pair production in proton-lead collisions at$\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}= 8.16$ TeV is performed using data corresponding to anintegrated luminosity of about 30 nb${}^{-1}$, collected with the LHCbexperiment. Production cross-sections for different pairs of charm hadrons aremeasured and kinematic correlations between the two charm hadrons areinvestigated. This is the first measurement of associated production of twocharm hadrons in proton-lead collisions. The results confirm the predictedenhancement of double parton scattering production in proton-lead collisionscompared to the single parton scattering production.

Furthermore, the branching fractionof $\psi(2S) \to \eta p \bar{p}$ is measured to be $(6.4\pm0.2\pm0.6)\times10^{-5}$."

Tairafun;2022/06/03;http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01380v1;Super-Kamiokande has been searching for neutrino bursts characteristic ofcore-collapse supernovae continuously, in real time, since the start ofoperations in 1996. The present work focuses on detecting more distantsupernovae whose event rate may be too small to trigger in real time, but maybe identified using an offline approach. The analysis of data collected from2008 to 2018 found no evidence of distant supernovae bursts. This establishesan upper limit of 0.29 year$^{-1}$ on the rate of core-collapse supernovae outto 100 kpc at 90% C.L.. For supernovae that fail to explode and collapsedirectly to black holes the limit reaches to 300 kpc.

Zunica;2020/11/10;http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05263v2;A search is performed for heavy neutrinos in the decay of a $W$ boson intotwo muons and a jet. The data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity ofapproximately $3.0 \text{ fb}^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data atcentre-of-mass energies of 7 and $8 \text{ TeV}$ collected with the LHCbexperiment. Both same-sign and opposite-sign muons in the final state areconsidered. Data are found to be consistent with the expected background. Upperlimits on the coupling of a heavy neutrino with the Standard Model neutrino areset at $95\%$ confidence level in the heavy-neutrino mass range from 5 to $50\text{ GeV}/c^2$. These are of the order of $10^{-3}$ forlepton-number-conserving decays and of the order of $10^{-4}$ forlepton-number-violating heavy-neutrino decays.

Zunica;2020/12/04;http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02696v2;Long-lived particles decaying to $e^\pm \mu^\mp \nu$, with masses between 7and $50$ GeV/c$^2$ and lifetimes between 2 and $50$ ps, are searched for bylooking at displaced vertices containing electrons and muons of oppositecharges. The search is performed using $5.4$ fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisionscollected with the LHCb detector at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13$TeV. Three mechanisms of production of long-lived particles are considered: thedirect pair production from quark interactions, the pair production from thedecay of a Standard-Model-like Higgs boson with a mass of $125$ GeV/c$^2$, andthe charged current production from an on-shell $W$ boson with an additionallepton. No evidence of these long-lived states is obtained and upper limits onthe production cross-section times branching fraction are set on the differentproduction modes.

The Cabibbo-suppressed decays $\Lambda_b^0\toD^0 p K^-$ and $\Lambda_b^0\to \Lambda_c^+ K^-$ are observed and theirbranching fractions are measured with respect to the decays $\Lambda_b^0\to D^0p \pi^-$ and $\Lambda_b^0\to \Lambda_c^+ \pi^-$. In addition, the firstobservation is reported of the decay of the neutral beauty-strange baryon$\Xi_b^0$ to the $D^0 p K^-$ final state, and a measurement of the $\Xi_b^0$mass is performed. Evidence of the $\Xi_b^0\to \Lambda_c^+ K^-$ decay is alsoreported.

Zhang;2018/12/18;http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07638v2;Motivated by the success of the flavour physics programme carried out overthe last decade at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), we characterize in detailthe physics potential of its High-Luminosity and High-Energy upgrades in thisdomain of physics. We document the extraordinary breadth of the HL/HE-LHCprogramme enabled by a putative Upgrade II of the dedicated flavour physicsexperiment LHCb and the evolution of the established flavour physics role ofthe ATLAS and CMS general purpose experiments. We connect the dedicated flavourphysics programme to studies of the top quark, Higgs boson, and directhigh-$p_T$ searches for new particles and force carriers. We discuss thecomplementarity of their discovery potential for physics beyond the StandardModel, affirming the necessity to fully exploit the LHC's flavour physicspotential throughout its upgrade eras.

It was launchedon the moonless night of the 25$^{th}$ of August 2014 from Timmins, Canada. Theflight ended successfully after maintaining the target altitude of 38 km forfive hours. One part of the mission was a 2.5 hour underflight using ahelicopter equipped with three UV light sources (LED, xenon flasher and laser)to perform an inflight calibration and examine the detectors capability tomeasure tracks moving at the speed of light. We describe the helicopter lasersystem and details of the underflight as well as how the laser tracks wererecorded and found in the data. These are the first recorded laser tracksmeasured from a fluorescence detector looking down on the atmosphere. Finally,we present a first reconstruction of the direction of the laser tracks relativeto the detector.

Zeller;2022/07/13;http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06337v1;In this work we present a keV-scale sterile-neutrino search with the firsttritium data of the KATRIN experiment, acquired in the commissioning run in2018. KATRIN performs a spectroscopic measurement of the tritium $\beta$-decayspectrum with the main goal of directly determining the effective electronanti-neutrino mass. During this commissioning phase a lower tritium activityfacilitated the search for sterile neutrinos with a mass of up to $1.6\,\mathrm{keV}$. We do not find a signal and set an exclusion limit on thesterile-to-active mixing amplitude of down to $\sin^2\theta < 5\cdot10^{-4}$($95\,\%$ C.L.), improving current laboratory-based bounds in thesterile-neutrino mass range between 0.1 and $1.0\, \mathrm{keV}$.

Woillez;2021/01/18;http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07098v2;Combining adaptive optics and interferometric observations results in aconsiderable contrast gain compared to single-telescope, extreme AO systems.Taking advantage of this, the ExoGRAVITY project is a survey of known younggiant exoplanets located in the range of 0.1'' to 2'' from their stars. Theobservations provide astrometric data of unprecedented accuracy, being crucialfor refining the orbital parameters of planets and illuminating their dynamicalhistories. Furthermore, GRAVITY will measure non-Keplerian perturbations due toplanet-planet interactions in multi-planet systems and measure dynamicalmasses. Over time, repetitive observations of the exoplanets at mediumresolution ($R=500$) will provide a catalogue of K-band spectra ofunprecedented quality, for a number of exoplanets. The K-band has the uniqueproperties that it contains many molecular signatures (CO, H$_2$O, CH$_4$,CO$_2$). This allows constraining precisely surface gravity, metallicity, andtemperature, if used in conjunction with self-consistent models like Exo-REM.Further, we will use the parameter-retrieval algorithm petitRADTRANS toconstrain the C/O ratio of the planets. Ultimately, we plan to produce thefirst C/O survey of exoplanets, kick-starting the difficult process of linkingplanetary formation with measured atomic abundances.

Zunica;2020/10/12;http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06011v2;An angular analysis of the $B^0 \to K^{*0} e^+ e^-$ decay is performed usinga data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $9~{\rm fb}^{-1}$ of$pp$ collisions collected with the LHCb experiment. The analysis is conductedin the very low dielectron mass squared ($q^2$) interval between $0.0008$ and$0.257~{\rm GeV}^2$, where the rate is dominated by the $B^0\to K^{\ast0}\gamma$ transition with a virtual photon. The fraction of longitudinalpolarisation of the $K^{\ast 0}$ meson, $F_{\rm L}$, is measured to be $F_{\rmL} = (4.4 \pm 2.6 \pm 1.4)\%$, where the first uncertainty is statistical andthe second systematic. The $A_{\rm T}^{\rm Re}$ observable, which is related tothe lepton forward-backward asymmetry, is measured to be $A_{\rm T}^{\rmRe}=-0.06 \pm 0.08 \pm 0.02$. The $A_{\rm T}^{(2)}$ and $A_{\rm T}^{\rm Im}$transverse asymmetries, which are sensitive to the virtual photon polarisation,are found to be $A_{\rm T}^{(2)} = 0.11 \pm 0.10 \ \pm 0.02$ and $A_{\rmT}^{\rm Im} = 0.02 \pm 0.10 \pm 0.01$. The results are consistent with StandardModel predictions and provide the world's best constraint on the $b\to s\gamma$photon polarisation.

Ziolkowski;2020/10/21;http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10953v1;Results of a search for ultra-high-energy neutrinos with the Pierre AugerObservatory from the direction of the blazar TXS 0506+056 are presented. Theywere obtained as part of the follow-up that stemmed from the detection ofhigh-energy neutrinos and gamma rays with IceCube, \textit{Fermi}-LAT, MAGIC,and other detectors of electromagnetic radiation in several bands. The PierreAuger Observatory is sensitive to neutrinos in the energy range from 100 PeV to100 EeV and in the zenith angle range from $\theta=60^\circ$ to$\theta=95^\circ$, where the zenith angle is measured from the verticaldirection. No neutrinos from the direction of TXS 0506+056 have been found. Theresults were analyzed in three periods: One of 6 months around the detection ofIceCube-170922A, coinciding with a flare period of TXS 0506+056, a second oneof 110 days during which the IceCube collaboration found an excess of 13neutrinos from a direction compatible with TXS 0506+056, and a third one from2004 January 1 up to 2018 August 31, over which the Pierre Auger Observatoryhas been taking data. The sensitivity of the Observatory is addressed fordifferent spectral indices by considering the fluxes that would induce a singleexpected event during the observation period. For indices compatible with thosemeasured by the IceCube collaboration the expected number of neutrinos at theObservatory is well-below one. Spectral indices as hard as 1.5 would have toapply in this energy range to expect a single event to have been detected.

Since the start of data taking more than 18 years ago, varioussearches for ultra-high-energy (UHE, $E\gtrsim10^{17}\,\text{eV}$) photons havebeen performed: either for a diffuse flux of UHE photons, for point sources ofUHE photons or for UHE photons associated with transient events likegravitational wave events. In the present paper, we summarize these searchesand review the current results obtained using the wealth of data collected bythe Pierre Auger Observatory.

KATRIN probes the effective electronanti-neutrino mass, $m_{\nu}$, via a high-precision measurement of the tritium$\beta$-decay spectrum close to its endpoint at $18.6\,\mathrm{keV}$. In thesecond physics run presented here, the source activity was increased by afactor of 3.8 and the background was reduced by $25\,\%$ with respect to thefirst campaign. A sensitivity on $m_{\nu}$ of $0.7\,\mathrm{eV/c^2}$ at$90\,\%$ confidence level (CL) was reached. This is the first sub-eVsensitivity from a direct neutrino-mass experiment. The best fit to thespectral data yields $m_{\nu}^2 = (0.26\pm0.34)\,\mathrm{eV^4/c^4}$, resultingin an upper limit of $m_{\nu}<0.9\,\mathrm{eV/c^2}$ ($90\,\%$ CL). By combiningthis result with the first neutrino mass campaign, we find an upper limit of$m_{\nu}<0.8\,\mathrm{eV/c^2}$ ($90\,\%$ CL).

Zonca;2014/05/05;http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0872v3;"Polarized emission observed by Planck HFI at 353 GHz towards a sample ofnearby fields is presented, focusing on the statistics of polarizationfractions $p$ and angles $\psi$. The polarization fractions and columndensities in these nearby fields are representative of the range of valuesobtained over the whole sky. We find that: (i) the largest polarizationfractions are reached in the most diffuse fields; (ii) the maximum polarizationfraction $p_\mathrm{max}$ decreases with column density $N_\mathrm{H}$ in themore opaque fields with $N_\mathrm{H} > 10^{21}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$; and (iii)the polarization fraction along a given line of sight is correlated with thelocal spatial coherence of the polarization angle. These observations arecompared to polarized emission maps computed in simulations of anisotropicmagnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence in which we assume a uniform intrinsicpolarization fraction of the dust grains. We find that an estimate of thisparameter may be recovered from the maximum polarization fraction$p_\mathrm{max}$ in diffuse regions where the magnetic field is ordered onlarge scales and perpendicular to the line of sight. This emphasizes the impactof anisotropies of the magnetic field on the emerging polarization signal. Thedecrease of the polarization fraction with column density in nearby molecularclouds is well reproduced in the simulations, indicating that it is essentiallydue to the turbulent structure of the magnetic field: an accumulation ofvariously polarized structures along the line of sight leads to such ananti-correlation. In the simulations, polarization fractions are also found toanti-correlate with the angle dispersion function $\mathcal{S}$. [abridged]"

Upper limits are set at $95\%$ credibility level on theratio of the $\mathit{\Xi}_{bc}^{0}$ production cross-section times itsbranching fraction to $D^0pK^-$ relative to that of the$\mathit{\Lambda}_{b}^{0} \to D^0pK^-$ decay. The limits are set as a functionof the $\mathit{\Xi}_{bc}^{0}$ mass and lifetime hypotheses, in the rapidityrange from 2.0 to 4.5 and in the transverse momentum region from 5 to 25$\mathrm{GeV}/c$. Upper limits range from $1.7\times10^{-2}$ to$3.0\times10^{-1}$ for the considered $\mathit{\Xi}_{bc}^{0}$ mass and lifetimehypotheses.

Zeller;2022/07/13;http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06326v1;Some extensions of the Standard Model of Particle Physics allow for Lorentzinvariance and Charge-Parity-Time (CPT)-invariance violations. In the neutrinosector strong constraints have been set by neutrino-oscillation andtime-of-flight experiments. However, some Lorentz-invariance-violatingparameters are not accessible via these probes. In this work, we focus on theparameters $(a_{\text{of}}^{(3)})_{00}$, $(a_{\text{of}}^{(3)})_{10}$ and$(a_{\text{of}}^{(3)})_{11}$ which would manifest themselves in a non-isotropicbeta-decaying source as a sidereal oscillation and an overall shift of thespectral endpoint. Based on the data of the first scientific run of the KATRINexperiment, we set the first limit on $\left|(a_{\text{of}}^{(3)})_{11}\right|$of $< 3.7\cdot10^{-6}$ GeV at 90\% confidence level. Moreover, we derive newconstraints on $(a_{\text{of}}^{(3)})_{00}$ and $(a_{\text{of}}^{(3)})_{10}$.

The sum of spectroscopicfactors of $\pi$0d$_{5/2}$ orbital is found to be $1.0 \pm 0.3$. However, thespectroscopic factor for the ground-state to ground-state transition ($^{25}$F,$^{24}$O$_{g.s.}$) is only $0.36\pm 0.13$, and $^{24}$O excited states areproduced from the 0d$_{5/2}$ proton knockout. The result shows that the$^{24}$O core of $^{25}$F nucleus significantly differs from a free $^{24}$Onucleus, and the core consists of 35% $^{24}$O$_{g.s}$. and 65% excited$^{24}$O.

Zweizig";2016/11/09;http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02972v1;"We present the results from an all-sky search for short-durationgravitational waves in the data of the first run of the Advanced LIGO detectorsbetween September 2015 and January 2016. The search algorithms use minimalassumptions on the signal morphology, so they are sensitive to a wide range ofsources emitting gravitational waves. The analyses target transient signalswith duration ranging from milliseconds to seconds over the frequency band of32 to 4096 Hz. The first observed gravitational-wave event, GW150914, has beendetected with high confidence in this search; other known gravitational-waveevents fall below the search's sensitivity. Besides GW150914, all of the searchresults are consistent with the expected rate of accidental noise coincidences.Finally, we estimate rate-density limits for a broad range of non-BBH transientgravitational-wave sources as a function of their gravitational radiationemission energy and their characteristic frequency. These rate-densityupper-limits are stricter than those previously published by anorder-of-magnitude."

Zunica;2020/07/22;http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11292v2;The decay $\Lambda_b^0 \to \eta_c(1S) p K^-$ is observed for the first timeusing a data sample of proton-proton collisions, corresponding to an integratedluminosity of 5.5 $fb^{-1}$, collected with the LHCb experiment at acenter-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The branching fraction of the decay ismeasured, using the $\Lambda_b^0 \to J/\psi p K^-$ decay as a normalizationmode, to be $\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_b^0 \to \eta_c(1S) pK^-)=(1.06\pm0.16\pm0.06^{+0.22}_{-0.19})\times10^{-4}$, where the quoteduncertainties are statistical, systematic and due to external inputs,respectively. A study of the $\eta_c(1S) p$ mass spectrum is performed tosearch for the $P_c(4312)^+$ pentaquark state. No evidence is observed and anupper limit of \begin{equation*} \frac{\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_b^0 \to P_c(4312)^+K^-)\times \mathcal{B}(P_c(4312)^+ \to \eta_c(1S) p)}{\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_b^0\to \eta_c(1S) p K^-)} < 0.24 \end{equation*} is obtained at the 95% confidencelevel.

Theresults are \begin{eqnarray*} C_{\pi\pi} & = & -0.311 \pm 0.045 \pm 0.015, \\S_{\pi\pi} & = & -0.706 \pm 0.042 \pm 0.013, \\ C_{KK} & = & \phantom{-}0.164\pm 0.034 \pm 0.014, \\ S_{KK} & = & \phantom{-}0.123 \pm 0.034 \pm 0.015, \\\cal {A}^{\mathrm{\Delta\Gamma}}_{\mathit{KK}} & = & -0.83\phantom{0} \pm0.05\phantom{0} \pm 0.09, \end{eqnarray*} where the first uncertainties arestatistical and the second systematic. The same data sample is used to measurethe time-integrated $CP$ asymmetries of $B^0\to K^+\pi^-$ and$B^0_\mathrm{s}\to K^-\pi^+$ decays and the results are \begin{eqnarray*}A_{CP}^{B^0} & = & -0.0824 \pm 0.0033 \pm 0.0033, \\ A_{CP}^{B^0_\mathrm{s}} &= & \phantom{-}0.236\phantom{0} \pm 0.013\phantom{0} \pm 0.011. \end{eqnarray*}All results are consistent with earlier measurements.

Zonneveld, S. Zucchelli, D. Zuliani, G. Zunica;2020/12/09;http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05143v2;The first observation of the suppressed semileptonic $B_s^0 \toK^-\mu^+\nu_\mu$ decay is reported. Using a data sample recorded in {\it pp}collisions in 2012 with the LHCb detector, corresponding to an integratedluminosity of 2 $\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$, the branching fraction\mbox{$\mathcal{B}(B_s^0 \to K^-\mu^+\nu_\mu)$} is measured to be$(1.06\pm0.05~(\mathrm{stat})\pm0.08~(\mathrm{syst}))\times 10^{-4}$, where thefirst uncertainty is statistical and the second one represents the combinedsystematic uncertainties. The decay $B_s^0 \to D_s^-\mu^+\nu_\mu$, where$D_s^-$ is reconstructed in the final state $K^+K^-\pi^-$, is used as anormalization channel to minimize the experimental systematic uncertainty.Theoretical calculations on the form factors of the $B_s^0 \to K^-$ and $B_s^0\to D_s^-$ transitions are employed to determine the ratio of the CKM matrixelements ${|V_{ub}|}/{|V_{cb}|}$ at low and high $B_s^0 \to K^-$ momentumtransfer.

Zou;2012/11/15;http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3600v2;Using a sample of 225.3 million $\jpsi$ events collected with the BESIIIdetector at the BEPCII $e^+e^-$ collider in 2009, searches for the decays of$\eta$ and $\eta^\prime\to\pi^+ e^- \bar{\nu}_e +c.c.$ in $\jpsi \to \phi \eta$and $\phi\eta^\prime$ are performed. The $\phi$ signals, which arereconstructed in $K^+K^-$ final states, are used to tag $\eta$ and$\eta^\prime$ semileptonic decays. No signals are observed for either $\eta$ or$\eta^\prime$, and upper limits at the 90% confidence level are determined tobe $7.3\times 10^{-4}$ and $5.0\times 10^{-4}$ for the ratios $\frac{{\mathcalB}(\eta\to \pi^+ e^- \bar{\nu}_e +c.c.)}{{\mathcal B}(\eta \to \pip\pim\piz)}$and $\frac{{\mathcal B}(\eta^\prime\to \pi^+ e^-\bar{\nu}_e +c.c.)}{{\mathcalB}(\eta^\prime \to \pip\pim\eta)}$, respectively. These are the first upperlimit values determined for $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$ semileptonic weak decays.

Wang;2017/05/26;http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09722v4;To study the nature of the state $Y(2175)$, a dedicated data set of $e^+e^-$collision data was collected at the center-of-mass energy of 2.125 GeV with theBESIII detector at the BEPCII collider. By analyzing large-angle Bhabhascattering events, the integrated luminosity of this data set is determined tobe $108.49\pm0.02\pm0.85$ pb$^{-1}$, where the first uncertainty is statisticaland the second one is systematic. In addition, the center-of-mass energy of thedata set is determined with radiative dimuon events to be$2126.55\pm0.03\pm0.85$ MeV, where the first uncertainty is statistical and thesecond one is systematic.

Zvyagin;2014/01/21;http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5361v2;A search for heavy Majorana neutrinos produced in the $B^- \to\pi^+\mu^-\mu^-$ decay mode is performed using 3 fb$^{-1}$ of integratedluminosity collected with the LHCb detector in $pp$ collisions atcenter-of-mass energies of 7 TeV and 8 TeV at the LHC. Neutrinos with masses inthe range 250-5000 MeV and lifetimes from zero to 1000 ps are probed. In theabsence of a signal, upper limits are set on the branching fraction${\cal{B}}(B^- \to \pi^+\mu^-\mu^-)$ as functions of neutrino mass andlifetime. These limits are on the order of $10^{-9}$ for short neutrinolifetimes of 1 ps or less. Limits are also set on the coupling between the muonand a possible fourth-generation neutrino.

Zvyagin;2014/01/27;http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.6932v1;The lifetime of the $B_c^+$ meson is measured using semileptonic decayshaving a $J\!/\!\psi$ meson and a muon in the final state. The data,corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $2\mathrm{~fb^{-1}}$, arecollected by the LHCb detector in $pp$ collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of$8\,\mathrm{TeV}$. The measured lifetime is $$\tau = 509 \pm 8 \pm 12\mathrm{~fs},$$ where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second issystematic.

Zucchelli, D. Zuliani, G. Zunica;2020/11/03;http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01867v3;The decays $B^0_s \rightarrow J/\psi \pi^+\pi^- K^+ K^-$ are studied using adata set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 9fb$^{-1}$, collectedwith the LHCb detector in proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energiesof 7, 8 and 13TeV. The decays $B^0_s \rightarrow J/\psi K^{\ast0}\bar{K}^{\ast0}$ and $B^0_s \rightarrow \chi_{c1}(3872)K^+K^-$, where the$K^+K^-$ pair does not originate from a $\phi$ meson, are observed for thefirst time. Precise measurements of the ratios of branching fractions betweenintermediate $\chi_{c1}(3872)\phi$, $J/\psi K^{\ast0}\bar{K}^{\ast0}$,$\psi(2S)\phi$ and $\chi_{c1}(3872)K^+K^-$ states are reported. A structure,denoted as $X(4740)$, is observed in the $J/\psi\phi$ mass spectrum and,assuming a Breit-Wigner parameterisation, its mass and width are determined tobe \begin{eqnarray*} m_{X(4740)} & = & 4741 \pm 6 \pm 6\,{\mathrm{MeV}}/c^2 \,,\\ \Gamma_{X(4740)} & = & 53 \pm 15 \pm 11\,{\mathrm{MeV}} \,, \end{eqnarray*}where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. Inaddition, the most precise single measurement of the mass of the $B^0_s$ mesonis performed and gives a value of  $$ m_{B^0_s} = 5366.98 \pm 0.07 \pm 0.13\,{\mathrm{MeV}}/c^2\,. $$

Zunica;2021/07/20;http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09593v2;This article presents differential measurements of the asymmetry between$\Lambda_b^0$ and $\overline{\Lambda}_b^0$ baryon production rates inproton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s}=7$ and$8\,\textrm{TeV}$ collected with the LHCb experiment, corresponding to anintegrated luminosity of $3\,\textrm{fb}^{-1}$. The $\Lambda_b^0$ baryons arereconstructed through the inclusive semileptonic decay$\Lambda_b^0\rightarrow\Lambda_c^+\mu^-\overline{\nu}_{\mu}X$. The productionasymmetry is measured both in intervals of rapidity in the range $2.15<y<4.10$and transverse momentum in $2<p_T<27\,\textrm{GeV}/c$. The results are found tobe incompatible with symmetric production with a significance of 5.8 standarddeviations for both $\sqrt{s}=7$ and $8\,\textrm{TeV}$ data, assuming no $C\!P$violation in the decay. There is evidence for a trend as a function of rapiditywith a significance of 4 standard deviations. Comparisons to predictions fromhadronisation models in PYTHIA and heavy-quark recombination are provided. Thisresult constitutes the first observation of a particle-antiparticle asymmetryin $b$-hadron production at LHC energies.

Zykova;2020/04/11;http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05434v2;This paper reports the first simultaneous measurement of the doubledifferential muon neutrino charged-current cross section on oxygen and carbonwithout pions in the final state as a function of the outgoing muon kinematics,made at the ND280 off-axis near detector of the T2K experiment. The ratio ofthe oxygen and carbon cross sections is also provided to help validate variousmodels' ability to extrapolate between carbon and oxygen nuclear targets, as isrequired in T2K oscillation analyses. The data are taken using a neutrino beamwith an energy spectrum peaked at 0.6 GeV. The extracted measurement iscompared with the prediction from different Monte Carlo neutrino-nucleusinteraction event generators, showing particular model separation for veryforward-going muons. Overall, of the models tested, the result is bestdescribed using Local Fermi Gas descriptions of the nuclear ground state withRPA suppression.

Zunica;2020/11/18;http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09112v2;Using $pp$ collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of$5.4\,{\rm fb}^{-1}$ collected with the LHCb detector at a center-of-massenergy of $13\,{\rm TeV}$, the $B^0\to D^-D^+K^+\pi^-$ decay is studied. A newexcited $D_s^+$ meson is observed decaying into the $D^+K^+\pi^-$ final statewith large statistical significance. The pole mass and width, and thespin-parity of the new state are measured with an amplitude analysis to be$m_R=2591\pm6\pm7\,{\rm MeV}$, $\Gamma_R=89\pm16\pm12\,{\rm MeV}$ and$J^P=0^-$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the secondsystematic. Fit fractions for all components in the amplitude analysis are alsoreported. The new resonance, denoted as $D_{s0}(2590)^+$, is a strong candidateto be the $D_s(2^1{S}_0)^+$ state, the radial excitation of the pseudoscalarground-state $D_s^+$ meson.

Zunica;2020/11/24;http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12041v2;The CKM angle $\gamma$ is measured for the first time from mixing-induced$CP$ violation between $B^0_s \rightarrow D_s^\mp K^\pm \pi^\pm \pi^\mp$ and$\bar{B}^0_s \rightarrow D_s^\pm K^\mp \pi^\mp \pi^\pm$ decays reconstructed inproton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 9${\rm fb}^{-1}$ recorded with the LHCb detector. A time-dependent amplitudeanalysis is performed to extract the $CP$-violating weak phase$\gamma-2\beta_s$ and, subsequently, $\gamma$ by taking the$B^0_s$-$\bar{B}^0_s$ mixing phase $\beta_{s}$ as an external input. Themeasurement yields $\gamma = (44 \pm 12)^\circ$ modulo $180^\circ$, wherestatistical and systematic uncertainties are combined. An alternativemodel-independent measurement, integrating over the five-dimensional phasespace of the decay, yields $\gamma = (44^{\,+\,20}_{\,-\,13})^\circ$ modulo$180^\circ$. Moreover, the $B^0_s$-$\bar{B}^0_s$ oscillation frequency ismeasured from the flavour-specific control channel $B^0_s \rightarrow D_s^-\pi^+ \pi^+ \pi^-$ to be $\Delta m_s = (17.757 \pm 0.007 \,({\rm stat.}) \pm0.008 \,({\rm syst.})) \text{ps}^{-1}$, consistent with and more precise thanthe current world-average value.

Zumbruch;2018/11/15;http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06213v4;We investigate identical pion HBT intensity interferometry for central Au+Aucollisions at 1.23A GeV. High-statistics $\pi^-\pi^-$ and $\pi^+\pi^+$ data aremeasured with HADES at SIS18/GSI. The radius parameters, derived from thecorrelation function depending on relative momenta in the longitudinal-comovingsystem and parametrized as three-dimensional Gaussian distribution, are studiedas function of transverse momentum. A substantial charge-sign difference of thesource radii is found, particularly pronounced at low transverse momentum. Theextracted Coulomb-corrected source parameters agree well with a smoothextrapolation of the center-of-mass energy dependence established at higherenergies, extending the corresponding excitation functions down towards a verylow energy. Our data would thus rather disfavour any strong energy dependenceof the radius parameters in the low energy region.

Zweizig";2016/06/03;http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01210v1;This paper presents updated estimates of source parameters for GW150914, abinary black-hole coalescence event detected by the Laser InterferometerGravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) on September 14, 2015 [1]. Referencepresented parameter estimation [2] of the source using a 13-dimensional,phenomenological precessing-spin model (precessing IMRPhenom) and a11-dimensional nonprecessing effective-one-body (EOB) model calibrated tonumerical-relativity simulations, which forces spin alignment (nonprecessingEOBNR). Here we present new results that include a 15-dimensionalprecessing-spin waveform model (precessing EOBNR) developed within the EOBformalism. We find good agreement with the parameters estimated previously [2],and we quote updated component masses of $35^{+5}_{-3}\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and$30^{+3}_{-4}\mathrm{M}_\odot$ (where errors correspond to 90% symmetriccredible intervals). We also present slightly tighter constraints on thedimensionless spin magnitudes of the two black holes, with a primary spinestimate $0.65$ and a secondary spin estimate $0.75$ at 90% probability.Reference [2] estimated the systematic parameter-extraction errors due towaveform-model uncertainty by combining the posterior probability densities ofprecessing IMRPhenom and nonprecessing EOBNR. Here we find that the twoprecessing-spin models are in closer agreement, suggesting that thesesystematic errors are smaller than previously quoted.

Zvyagin;2014/01/14;http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3245v1;A search for associated production of a $Z$ boson with an open charm meson ispresented using a data sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of$1.0\,\mathrm{fb}^{-`}$ of proton--proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energyof 7\,TeV, collected by the LHCb experiment. %% Seven candidate events forassociated production of a $Z$ boson with a $D^0$ meson and four candidateevents for a $Z$ boson with a $D^+$ meson are observed with a combinedsignificance of 5.1standard deviations. The production cross-sections in theforward region are measured to be $$\sigma_{Z\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-\!,D^0} =2.50\pm1.12\pm0.22pb$$ $$\sigma_{Z\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-\!,D^+} =0.44\pm0.23\pm0.03pb,$$ where the first uncertainty is statistical and thesecond systematic.

Zou;2013/03/29;http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.7360v1;Based on a sample of 225.3 million J/\psi events accumulated with the BESIIIdetector at the BEPCII, the decays of \eta' to pi+pi-l+l- are studied viaJ/\psi to \gamma\eta'. A clear \eta' signal is observed in the pi+pi-e+e- massspectrum, and the branching fraction is measured to be \BR(\eta' to pi+pi-e+e-)= (2.11\pm0.12 (stat.)\pm0.15 (syst.))\times10^{-3}, which is in good agreementwith theoretical predictions and the previous measurement, but is determinedwith much higher precision. No \eta' signal is found in the pi+ pi- mu+ mu-mass spectrum, and the upper limit is determined to be \BR(\eta' to pi+ pi- mu+mu-)<2.9\times10^{-5} at the 90% confidence level.

Zunica;2020/10/29;http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15931v2;A structure is observed in the $B^+K^-$ mass spectrum in a sample ofproton--proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 7, 8, and 13 TeV,collected with the LHCb detector and corresponding to a total integratedluminosity of 9 fb${}^-1$. The structure is interpreted as the result ofoverlapping excited $B_s^0$ states. With high significance, a two-peakhypothesis provides a better description of the data than a single resonance.Under this hypothesis the masses and widths of the two states, assuming theydecay directly to $B^+K^-$, are determined to be  $m_1 = 6063.5 \pm 1.2 \text{ (stat)} \pm 0.8\text{ (syst) MeV},$  $\Gamma_1 = 26 \pm 4 \text{ (stat)} \pm 4\text{ (syst) MeV},$  $m_2 = 6114 \pm 3 \text{ (stat)} \pm 5\text{ (syst) MeV},$  $\Gamma_2 = 66 \pm 18 \text{ (stat)} \pm 21\text{ (syst) MeV}.$  Alternative values assuming a decay through $B^{*+}K^-$, with a missingphoton from the $B^{*+} \rightarrow B^+\gamma$ decay, which are shifted byapproximately 45 MeV are also determined. The possibility of a single statedecaying in both channels is also considered. The ratio of the total productioncross-section times branching fraction of the new states relative to thepreviously observed $B_{s2}^{*0}$ state is determined to be $0.87 \pm 0.15\text{ (stat)} \pm 0.19 \text{ (syst)}$.

Zunica;2021/08/30;http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13115v2;The production of prompt charged particles in proton-lead collisions and inproton-proton collisions at the nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy${\sqrt{s_{\scriptscriptstyle\mathrm{NN}}}=5\,\mathrm{TeV}}$ is studied at LHCbas a function of pseudorapidity ($\eta$) and transverse momentum($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) with respect to the proton beam direction. The nuclearmodification factor for charged particles is determined as a function of $\eta$between ${-4.8<\eta<-2.5}$ (backward region) and ${2.0<\eta<4.8}$ (forwardregion), and $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ between${0.2<p_{\mathrm{T}}<8.0\,\mathrm{GeV}/c}$. The results show a suppression ofcharged particle production in proton-lead collisions relative to proton-protoncollisions in the forward region and an enhancement in the backward region for$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ larger than $1.5\,\mathrm{GeV}/c$. This measurement constrainsnuclear PDFs and saturation models at previously unexplored values of theparton momentum fraction down to $10^{-6}$.

Zunica;2020/10/16;http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08483v2;A measurement of $CP$-violating observables is performed using the decays$B^\pm\to D K^\pm$ and $B^\pm\to D \pi^\pm$, where the $D$ meson isreconstructed in one of the self-conjugate three-body final states $K_{\mathrmS}\pi^+\pi^-$ and $K_{\mathrm S}K^+K^-$ (commonly denoted $K_{\mathrm S}h^+h^-$). The decays are analysed in bins of the $D$-decay phase space, leadingto a measurement that is independent of the modelling of the $D$-decayamplitude. The observables are interpreted in terms of the CKM angle $\gamma$.Using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of$9\,\text{fb}^{-1}$ collected in proton-proton collisions at centre-of-massenergies of $7$, $8$, and $13\,\text{TeV}$ with the LHCb experiment, $\gamma$is measured to be $\left(68.7^{+5.2}_{-5.1}\right)^\circ$. The hadronicparameters $r_B^{DK}$, $r_B^{D\pi}$, $\delta_B^{DK}$, and $\delta_B^{D\pi}$,which are the ratios and strong-phase differences of the suppressed andfavoured $B^\pm$ decays, are also reported.

Zunica;2020/09/14;http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06619v2;The production of $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ and $\psi(2S)$ hadrons is studied as afunction of charged particle multiplicity in $pp$ collisions at acenter-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2fb$^{-1}$. For both states, the fraction that is produced promptly at thecollision vertex is found to decrease as charged particle multiplicityincreases. The ratio of $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ to $\psi(2S)$ cross-sections forpromptly produced particles is also found to decrease with multiplicity, whileno significant dependence on multiplicity is observed for the equivalent ratioof particles produced away from the collision vertex in $b$-hadron decays. Thisbehavior is consistent with a calculation that models the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$structure as a compact tetraquark. Comparisons with model calculations andimplications for the binding energy of the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ state arediscussed.

Zvyagin;2013/12/04;http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1217v1;The first measurement of the effective lifetime of the $\bar{B}_s^0$ meson inthe decay $\bar{B}_s^0\to D_s^-D_s^+$ is reported using a proton-protoncollision dataset, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb$^{-1}$,collected by the LHCb experiment. The measured value of the $\bar{B}_s^0\toD_s^-D_s^+$ effective lifetime is $1.379\pm0.026\pm0.017$ ps, where theuncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively. This lifetimetranslates into a measurement of the decay width of the light $\bar{B}_s^0$mass eigenstate of \Gamma_L$=0.725\pm0.014\pm0.009$ ps$^{-1}$. The$\bar{B}_s^0$ lifetime is also measured using the flavor-specific$\bar{B}_s^0\to D^-D_s^+$ decay to be $1.52\pm0.15\pm0.01 {\rm ps}$.

Zvyagin;2014/01/14;http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3288v2;The differential cross-section as a function of rapidity has been measuredfor the exclusive production of $J/\psi$ and $\psi(2S)$ mesons in proton-protoncollisions at $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV, using data collected by the LHCb experiment,corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 930 pb$^{-1}$. The cross-sectionstimes branching fractions to two muons having pseudorapidities between 2.0 and4.5 are measured to be $$\begin{array}{rl} \sigma_{pp\rightarrowJ/\psi\rightarrow{\mu^+}{\mu^-}}(2.0<\eta_{\mu^\pm }<4.5)=&291\pm 7\pm19 {\rm \pb},\\\sigma_{pp\rightarrow\psi(2S)\rightarrow{\mu^+}{\mu^-}}(2.0<\eta_{\mu^\pm}<4.5)=&6.5\pm0.9\pm 0.4 {\rm \ pb},\end{array}$$ where the first uncertainty is statisticaland the second is systematic. The measurements agree with next-to-leading orderQCD predictions as well as with models that include saturation effects.

Zvyagin;2013/10/29;http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.7953v2;A search for CP violation in the phase space of the decay$D^+\to\pi^-\pi^+\pi^+$ is reported using $pp$ collision data, corresponding toan integrated luminosity of 1.0 fb$^{-1}$, collected by the LHCb experiment ata centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. The Dalitz plot distributions for $3.1\times10^6$ $D^+$ and $D^-$ candidates are compared with binned and unbinnedmodel-independent techniques. No evidence for CP violation is found.

A low background rateis crucial to achieving the proposed sensitivity, and dedicated measurementshave been performed to study possible sources of background electrons. In thiswork, we test the hypothesis that gamma radiation from external radioactivesources significantly increases the rate of background events created in themain spectrometer (MS) and observed in the focal-plane detector. Using detailedsimulations of the gamma flux in the experimental hall, combined with a seriesof experimental tests that artificially increased or decreased the local gammaflux to the MS, we set an upper limit of 0.006 count/s (90% C.L.) from thismechanism. Our results indicate the effectiveness of the electrostatic andmagnetic shielding used to block secondary electrons emitted from the innersurface of the MS.

We use an astrophysical model with two extragalactic sourcepopulations to model the hardening of the cosmic-ray flux at around $5\times10^{18}$ eV (the so-called ""ankle"" feature) as a transition between these twocomponents. We find our data to be well reproduced if sources above the ankleemit a mixed composition with a hard spectrum and a low rigidity cutoff. Thecomponent below the ankle is required to have a very soft spectrum and a mix ofprotons and intermediate-mass nuclei. The origin of this intermediate-masscomponent is not well constrained and it could originate from either Galacticor extragalactic sources. To the aim of evaluating our capability to constrainastrophysical models, we discuss the impact on the fit results of the mainexperimental systematic uncertainties and of the assumptions about quantitiesaffecting the air shower development as well as the propagation and redshiftdistribution of injected ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs)."

We presentthe first data analysis with 7.1 kg y of total TeO_2 exposure focusing onbackground measurements and energy resolution. The background rates in theneutrinoless double-beta decay region of interest (2.47 to 2.57 MeV) and in the{\alpha} background-dominated region (2.70 to 3.90 MeV) have been measured tobe 0.071 \pm 0.011 and 0.019 \pm 0.002 counts/keV/kg/y, respectively. Thelatter result represents a factor of 6 improvement from a predecessorexperiment, Cuoricino. The results verify our understanding of the backgroundsources in CUORE-0, which is the basis of extrapolations to the full CUOREdetector. The obtained energy resolution (full width at half maximum) in theregion of interest is 5.7 keV. Based on the measured background rate and energyresolution in the region of interest, CUORE-0 half-life sensitivity is expectedto surpass the observed lower bound of Cuoricino with one year of live time.

Thesethree fields are measured using roughly 1300 sq. deg. of overlapping opticalimaging data from first year observations of the Dark Energy Survey andmillimeter-wave observations of the CMB from both the South Pole TelescopeSunyaev-Zel'dovich survey and Planck. We present cosmological constraints fromthe joint analysis of the two-point correlation functions between galaxydensity and galaxy shear with CMB lensing. We test for consistency betweenthese measurements and the DES-only two-point function measurements, finding noevidence for inconsistency in the context of flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmologicalmodels. Performing a joint analysis of five of the possible correlationfunctions between these fields (excluding only the CMB lensing autospectrum)yields $S_{8}\equiv \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3} =0.782^{+0.019}_{-0.025}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.260^{+0.029}_{-0.019}$. We testfor consistency between these five correlation function measurements and thePlanck-only measurement of the CMB lensing autospectrum, again finding noevidence for inconsistency in the context of flat $\Lambda$CDM models.Combining constraints from all six two-point functions yields$S_{8}=0.776^{+0.014}_{-0.021}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}= 0.271^{+0.022}_{-0.016}$.These results provide a powerful test and confirmation of the results from thefirst year DES joint-probes analysis.

Zonca;2011/01/11;http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.2027v1;We present the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) signal-to-richness scaling relation(Y500-N200) for the MaxBCG cluster catalogue. Employing a multi-frequencymatched filter on the Planck sky maps, we measure the SZ signal for eachcluster by adapting the filter according to weak-lensing calibratedmass-richness relations (N200-M500). We bin our individual measurements anddetect the SZ signal down to the lowest richness systems (N200=10) with highsignificance, achieving a detection of the SZ signal in systems with mass aslow as M500~5e13 Msolar. The observed Y500-N200 relation is well modeled by apower law over the full richness range. It has a lower normalisation at givenN200 than predicted based on X-ray models and published mass-richnessrelations. An X-ray subsample, however, does conform to the predicted scaling,and model predictions do reproduce the relation between our measuredbin-average SZ signal and measured bin-average X-ray luminosities. At fixedrichness, we find an intrinsic dispersion in the Y500-N200 relation of 60%rising to of order 100% at low richness. Thanks to its all-sky coverage, Planckprovides observations for more than 13,000 MaxBCG clusters and an unprecedentedSZ/optical data set, extending the list of known cluster scaling laws toinclude SZ-optical properties. The data set offers essential clues for modelsof galaxy formation. Moreover, the lower normalisation of the SZ-mass relationimplied by the observed SZ-richness scaling has important consequences forcluster physics and cosmological studies with SZ clusters.

Theexperiment took data from 2008 to 2012 in the CERN Neutrinos to Gran Sassobeam. The observation of $\nu_{\mu} \rightarrow \nu_{\tau}$ appearance,achieved with four candidate events in a sub-sample of the data, was previouslyreported. In this paper, a fifth $\nu_{\tau}$ candidate event, found in anenlarged data sample, is described. Together with a further reduction of theexpected background, the candidate events detected so far allow assessing thediscovery of $\nu_{\mu}\rightarrow \nu_{\tau}$ oscillations in appearance modewith a significance larger than 5 $\sigma$.

Zweizig";2016/12/06;http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02030v4;We employ gravitational-wave radiometry to map the gravitational wavesstochastic background expected from a variety of contributing mechanisms andtest the assumption of isotropy using data from Advanced LIGO's first observingrun. We also search for persistent gravitational waves from point sources withonly minimal assumptions over the 20 - 1726 Hz frequency band. Finding noevidence of gravitational waves from either point sources or a stochasticbackground, we set limits at 90% confidence. For broadband point sources, wereport upper limits on the gravitational wave energy flux per unit frequency inthe range $F_{\alpha,\Theta}(f) < (0.1 - 56) \times 10^{-8}$ erg cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ (f/25 Hz)$^{\alpha-1}$ depending on the sky location$\Theta$ and the spectral power index $\alpha$. For extended sources, we reportupper limits on the fractional gravitational wave energy density required toclose the Universe of $\Omega(f,\Theta) < (0.39-7.6) \times 10^{-8}$ sr$^{-1}$(f/25 Hz)$^\alpha$ depending on $\Theta$ and $\alpha$. Directed searches fornarrowband gravitational waves from astrophysically interesting objects(Scorpius X-1, Supernova 1987 A, and the Galactic Center) yield medianfrequency-dependent limits on strain amplitude of $h_0 <$ (6.7, 5.5, and 7.0)$\times 10^{-25}$ respectively, at the most sensitive detector frequenciesbetween 130 - 175 Hz. This represents a mean improvement of a factor of 2across the band compared to previous searches of this kind for these skylocations, considering the different quantities of strain constrained in eachcase.

Zunica;2021/03/20;http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11058v2;Searches for $CP$ violation in the two-body decays $D_{(s)}^{+}\rightarrowh^{+}\pi^{0}$ and $D_{(s)}^{+} \rightarrow h^{+}\eta$ (where $h^{+}$ denotes a$\pi^{+}$ or $K^{+}$ meson) are performed using $pp$ collision data collectedby the LHCb experiment corresponding to either 9 fb$^{-1}$ or 6 fb$^{-1}$ ofintegrated luminosity. The $\pi^{0}$ and $\eta$ mesons are reconstructed usingthe $e^{+}e^{-}\gamma$ final state, which can proceed as three-body decays$\pi^{0}\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}\gamma$ and $\eta \rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}\gamma$,or via the two-body decays $\pi^{0}\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ and$\eta\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$ followed by a photon conversion. The measurementsare made relative to the control modes $D_{(s)}^{+}\rightarrow K_{S}^{0} h^{+}$to cancel the production and detection asymmetries. The $CP$ asymmetries aremeasured to be \begin{align} \mathcal{A}_{CP}(D^{+}\rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{0})&= (-1.3 \pm 0.9 \pm 0.6 )\%, \end{align} \begin{align}\mathcal{A}_{CP}(D^{+}\rightarrow K^{+}\pi^{0}) &= (-3.2 \pm 4.7 \pm 2.1 )\%,\end{align} \begin{align} \mathcal{A}_{CP}(D^{+}\rightarrow \pi^{+}\eta) &=(-0.2 \pm 0.8 \pm 0.4 )\%, \end{align} \begin{align}\mathcal{A}_{CP}(D^{+}\rightarrow K^{+}\eta) &= (-6 \pm 10 \pm 4 )\%,\end{align} \begin{align} \mathcal{A}_{CP}(D_{s}^{+}\rightarrow K^{+}\pi^{0})&= (-0.8 \pm 3.9 \pm 1.2 )\%, \end{align} \begin{align}\mathcal{A}_{CP}(D_{s}^{+}\rightarrow \pi^{+}\eta) &= (0.8 \pm 0.7 \pm 0.5 )\%,\end{align} \begin{align} \mathcal{A}_{CP}(D_{s}^{+}\rightarrow K^{+}\eta) &=(0.9 \pm 3.7 \pm 1.1 )\%, \end{align} where the first uncertainties arestatistical and the second systematic. These results are consistent with no$CP$ violation and mostly constitute the most precise measurements of$\mathcal{A}_{CP}$ in these decay modes to date.

Zonca;2013/03/20;http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5087v3;Our velocity relative to the rest frame of the cosmic microwave background(CMB) generates a dipole temperature anisotropy on the sky which has been wellmeasured for more than 30 years, and has an accepted amplitude of v/c =0.00123, or v = 369km/s. In addition to this signal generated by Dopplerboosting of the CMB monopole, our motion also modulates and aberrates the CMBtemperature fluctuations (as well as every other source of radiation atcosmological distances). This is an order 0.1% effect applied to fluctuationswhich are already one part in roughly one hundred thousand, so it is quitesmall. Nevertheless, it becomes detectable with the all-sky coverage, highangular resolution, and low noise levels of the Planck satellite. Here wereport a first measurement of this velocity signature using the aberration andmodulation effects on the CMB temperature anisotropies, finding a component inthe known dipole direction, (l,b)=(264, 48) [deg], of 384km/s +- 78km/s (stat.)+- 115km/s (syst.). This is a significant confirmation of the expectedvelocity.

Zou;2022/01/26;http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10796v2;Based on $(10087\pm44)\times10^{6}$ $J/\psi$ events collected with the BESIIIdetector, the process $J/\psi\rightarrow\gamma\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\eta'$ is studiedusing two dominant decay channels of the $\eta'$ meson,$\eta'\rightarrow\gamma\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ and$\eta'\rightarrow\eta\pi^{+}\pi^{-},\eta\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$. The $X(2600)$is observed with a statistical significance larger than 20$\sigma$ in the$\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\eta'$ invariant mass spectrum, and it has a strong correlationto a structure around 1.5$~\mathrm{GeV}$/{\it c}$^{2}$ in the $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$invariant mass spectrum. A simultaneous fit on the $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\eta'$ and$\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ invariant mass spectra with the two $\eta'$ decay modesindicates that the mass and width of the $X(2600)$ state are $2617.8\pm2.1^{+18.2}_{-1.9}~\mathrm{MeV}$/{\it c}$^{2}$ and$200\pm8^{+20}_{-17}~\mathrm{MeV}$, respectively. The corresponding branchingfractions are measured to be $B(J/\psi\rightarrow\gamma X(2600))\cdotB(X(2600)\rightarrow f_{0}(1500)\eta')\cdotB(f_{0}(1500)\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-})$ =($3.39\pm0.18^{+0.91}_{-0.66})\times10^{-5}$ and $B(J/\psi\rightarrow\gammaX(2600))\cdot B(X(2600)\rightarrow f_{2}^{'}(1525)\eta')\cdotB(f_{2}^{'}(1525)\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-})$ =($2.43\pm0.13^{+0.31}_{-1.11})\times10^{-5}$, where the first uncertainties arestatistical, and the second systematic.

Zvyagin;2013/10/30;http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.8197v2;A measurement of the $Z(\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-)$+jet production cross-sectionin $pp$ collisions at a centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV is presented.The analysis is based on an integrated luminosity of $1.0\,\text{fb}^{-1}$recorded by the LHCb experiment. Results are shown with two jet transversemomentum thresholds, 10 and 20 GeV, for both the overall cross-section withinthe fiducial volume, and for six differential cross-section measurements. Thefiducial volume requires that both the jet and the muons from the Z boson decayare produced in the forward direction ($2.0<\eta<4.5$). The results show goodagreement with theoretical predictions at the second-order expansion in thecoupling of the strong interaction.

Zou;2022/09/22;http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11175v1;Using a sample of $(10.09\pm0.04)\times10^{9}$ $J/\psi$ decays collected withthe BESIII detector, partial wave analyses of the decay $J/\psi\to\gammaK^{0}_{S} K^{0}_{S}\pi^{0}$ are performed within the $K^{0}_{S}K^{0}_{S}\pi^{0}$ invariant mass region below 1.6 ${\textrm{GeV}/c^2}$. Thecovariant tensor amplitude method is used in both mass independent and massdependent approaches. Both analysis approaches exhibit dominant pseudoscalarand axial vector components, and show good consistency for the other individualcomponents. Furthermore, the mass dependent analysis reveals that the$K^{0}_{S} K^{0}_{S}\pi^{0}$ invariant mass spectrum for the pseudoscalarcomponent can be well described with two isoscalar resonant states, ${\iti.e.}$, the $\eta(1405)$ with a mass of $1391.7\pm0.7_{-0.3}^{+11.3}$$\textrm{MeV}/c^2$ and a width of $60.8\pm1.2_{-12.0}^{+5.5}$ $\textrm{MeV}$,and the $\eta(1475)$ with a mass of $1507.6\pm1.6_{-32.2}^{+15.5}$$\textrm{MeV}/c^2$ and a width of $115.8\pm2.4_{-10.9}^{+14.8}$ $\textrm{MeV}$.The first and second uncertainties are statistical and systematic,respectively. Alternate models for the pseudoscalar component are also tested,but the description of the $K^{0}_{S} K^{0}_{S}\pi^{0}$ invariant mass spectrumdeteriorates significantly.

The detector consists of an array of 988 TeO2 crystals, for a totalmass of 742 kg. CUORE is presently in data taking, searching for theneutrinoless double beta decay of 130 Te. CUORE is operational since the springof 2017. The initial science run already allowed to provide the most stringentlimit on the neutrinoless double beta decay half-life of 130Te, and to performthe most precise measurement of the two-neutrino double beta decay half-life.Up to date, we have more than doubled the collected exposure. In this talk, wepresenteded the most recent results and discuss the present status of the CUOREexperiment.

Zvyagin;2013/10/08;http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2145v2;Decays of Bs and B0 mesons into J/\psi \pi +\pi -\pi +\pi - final states,produced in pp collisions at the LHC, are investigated using data correspondingto an integrated luminosity of 3/fb collected with the LHCb detector. B^0_(s)-> J\psi f_1(1285) decays are seen for the first time, and the branchingfractions are measured. Using these rates, the f_1(1285) mixing angle betweenstrange and non-strange components of its wave function in the q-qbar structuremodel is determined to be \pm (24.0^{+3.1+0.6}_{-2.6-0.8}) degrees.Implications on the possible tetraquark nature of the f_1(1285) are discussed.

Zvyagin;2013/10/09;http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2535v3;A search for the D0 to \pi+ \pi- \mu+ \mu- decay, where the muon pair doesnot originate from a resonance, is performed using proton-proton collision datacorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0 fb-1 recorded by the LHCbexperiment at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. No signal is observed and anupper limit on the relative branching fraction with respect to the resonantdecay mode D0 to \pi+ \pi- \phi(to \mu+ \mu-), under the assumption of aphase-space model, is found to be B(D0 to \pi+ \pi- mu+ mu-)/B(D0 to \pi+ \pi-\phi(to \mu+ \mu-)) < 0.96 at the 90% confidence level. The upper limit on theabsolute branching fraction is evaluated to be B(D0 to \pi+ \pi- \mu+ \mu-) <5.5 x 10-7 at 90% confidence level. This is the most stringent to date.

Zonca;2011/01/11;http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.2043v2;All-sky data from the Planck survey and the Meta-Catalogue of X-ray detectedClusters of galaxies (MCXC) are combined to investigate the relationshipbetween the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) signal and X-ray luminosity. Thesample comprises ~ 1600 X-ray clusters with redshifts up to ~ 1 and spans awide range in X-ray luminosity. The SZ signal is extracted for each objectindividually, and the statistical significance of the measurement is maximisedby averaging the SZ signal in bins of X-ray luminosity, total mass, orredshift. The SZ signal is detected at very high significance over more thantwo decades in X-ray luminosity (10^43 erg/s < L_500 E(z)^-7/3 < 2 X 10^45erg/s). The relation between intrinsic SZ signal and X-ray luminosity isinvestigated and the measured SZ signal is compared to values predicted fromX-ray data. Planck measurements and X-ray based predictions are found to be inexcellent agreement over the whole explored luminosity range. No significantdeviation from standard evolution of the scaling relations is detected. For thefirst time the intrinsic scatter in the scaling relation between SZ signal andX-ray luminosity is measured and found to be consistent with the one in theluminosity -- mass relation from X-ray studies. There is no evidence of anydeficit in SZ signal strength in Planck data relative to expectations from theX-ray properties of clusters, underlining the robustness and consistency of ouroverall view of intra-cluster medium properties.

Zonca;2014/07/24;http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.6663v1;We present the results of approximately three years of observations of PlanckSunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) sources with the Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope(RTT150), as a part of the optical follow-up programme undertaken by the Planckcollaboration. During this time period approximately 20% of all dark and greyclear time available at the telescope was devoted to observations of Planckobjects. Some observations of distant clusters were also done at the 6-mBolshoy Telescope Azimutal'ny (BTA) of the Special Astrophysical Observatory ofthe Russian Academy of Sciences. In total, deep, direct images of more than onehundred fields were obtained in multiple filters. We identified 47 previouslyunknown galaxy clusters, 41 of which are included in the Planck catalogue of SZsources. The redshifts of 65 Planck clusters were measured spectroscopicallyand 14 more were measured photometrically. We discuss the details of clusteroptical identifications and redshift measurements. We also present newspectroscopic redhifts for 39 Planck clusters that were not included in thePlanck SZ source catalogue and are published here for the first time.

Zlochower";2016/06/03;http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01262v1;We compare GW150914 directly to simulations of coalescing binary black holesin full general relativity, accounting for all the spin-weighted quadrupolarmodes, and separately accounting for all the quadrupolar and octopolar modes.Consistent with the posterior distributions reported in LVC_PE[1] (at 90%confidence), we find the data are compatible with a wide range of nonprecessingand precessing simulations. Followup simulations performed usingpreviously-estimated binary parameters most resemble the data. Comparisonsincluding only the quadrupolar modes constrain the total redshifted mass Mz \in[64 - 82M_\odot], mass ratio q = m2/m1 \in [0.6,1], and effective aligned spin\chi_eff \in [-0.3, 0.2], where \chi_{eff} = (S1/m1 + S2/m2) \cdot\hat{L} /M.Including both quadrupolar and octopolar modes, we find the mass ratio is evenmore tightly constrained. Simulations with extreme mass ratios and effectivespins are highly inconsistent with the data, at any mass. Several nonprecessingand precessing simulations with similar mass ratio and \chi_{eff} areconsistent with the data. Though correlated, the components' spins (both inmagnitude and directions) are not significantly constrained by the data. Fornonprecessing binaries, interpolating between simulations, we reconstruct aposterior distribution consistent with previous results. The final black hole'sredshifted mass is consistent with Mf,z between 64.0 - 73.5M_\odot and thefinal black hole's dimensionless spin parameter is consistent with af = 0.62 -0.73. As our approach invokes no intermediate approximations to generalrelativity and can strongly reject binaries whose radiation is inconsistentwith the data, our analysis provides a valuable complement to LVC_PE[1].

Evidence for $\Lambda^{+}_{c}\to p\eta^{\prime}$ with a statisticalsignificance of $3.6\sigma$ is reported with a double-tag approach. The$\Lambda^{+}_{c}\to p\eta^{\prime}$ absolute branching fraction is determinedto be $(5.62^{+2.46}_{-2.04} \pm 0.26)\times 10^{-4}$, where the first andsecond uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively.

Zepeda;2020/11/12;http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06633v2;AMIGA (Auger Muons and Infill for the Ground Array) is an upgrade of thePierre Auger Observatory to complement the study of ultra-high-energy cosmicrays (UHECR) by measuring the muon content of extensive air showers (EAS). Itconsists of an array of 61 water Cherenkov detectors on a denser spacing incombination with underground scintillation detectors used for muon densitymeasurement. Each detector is composed of three scintillation modules, with 10m$^2$ detection area per module, buried at 2.3 m depth, resulting in a totaldetection area of 30 m$^2$. Silicon photomultiplier sensors (SiPM) measure theamount of scintillation light generated by charged particles traversing themodules. In this paper, the design of the front-end electronics to process thesignals of those SiPMs and test results from the laboratory and from the PierreAuger Observatory are described. Compared to our previous prototype, the newelectronics shows a higher performance, higher efficiency and lower powerconsumption, and it has a new acquisition system with increased dynamic rangethat allows measurements closer to the shower core. The new acquisition systemis based on the measurement of the total charge signal that the muoniccomponent of the cosmic ray shower generates in the detector.

Zunica;2021/05/31;http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14738v3;A flavour-tagged time-dependent angular analysis of $B^0_s\to J/\psi\phi$decays is presented where the $J/\psi$ meson is reconstructed through its decayto an $e^+e^-$ pair. The analysis uses a sample of $pp$ collision data recordedwith the LHCb experiment at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV,corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb$^{-1}$. The $CP$-violatingphase and lifetime parameters of the $B^0_s$ system are measured to be$\phi_s=0.00\pm0.28\pm0.07$ rad, $\Delta\Gamma_s=0.115\pm0.045\pm0.011$ps$^{-1}$ and $\Gamma_s=0.608\pm0.018\pm0.012$ ps$^{-1}$ where the firstuncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. This is the first timethat $CP$-violating parameters are measured in the $B^0_s\to J/\psi\phi$ decaywith an $e^+e^-$ pair in the final state. The results are consistent withprevious measurements in other channels and with the Standard Modelpredictions.

Zou;2022/06/17;http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08554v2;Using about 23 $\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$ of data collected with the BESIII detectoroperating at the BEPCII storage ring, a precise measurement of the $e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{-}J/\psi$ Born cross section is performed atcenter-of-mass energies from 3.7730 to 4.7008 GeV. Two structures, identifiedas the $Y(4220)$ and the $Y(4320)$ states, are observed in the energy-dependentcross section with a significance larger than $10\sigma$. The masses and widthsof the two structures are determined to be ($M, \Gamma$) =($4221.4\pm1.5\pm2.0$ MeV/$c^{2}$, $41.8\pm2.9\pm2.7$ MeV) and ($M, \Gamma$) =($4298\pm12\pm26$ MeV/$c^{2}$, $127\pm17\pm10$ MeV), respectively. A smallenhancement around 4.5 GeV with a significance about $3\sigma$, compatible withthe $\psi(4415)$, might also indicate the presence of an additional resonancein the spectrum. The inclusion of this additional contribution in the fit tothe cross section affects the resonance parameters of the $Y(4320)$ state.

Zlochower;2016/02/11;http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03840v2;"On September 14, 2015, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-waveObservatory (LIGO) detected a gravitational-wave transient (GW150914); wecharacterize the properties of the source and its parameters. The data aroundthe time of the event were analyzed coherently across the LIGO network using asuite of accurate waveform models that describe gravitational waves from acompact binary system in general relativity. GW150914 was produced by a nearlyequal mass binary black hole of $36^{+5}_{-4} M_\odot$ and $29^{+4}_{-4}M_\odot$; for each parameter we report the median value and the range of the90% credible interval. The dimensionless spin magnitude of the more massiveblack hole is bound to be $<0.7$ (at 90% probability). The luminosity distanceto the source is $410^{+160}_{-180}$ Mpc, corresponding to a redshift$0.09^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ assuming standard cosmology. The source location isconstrained to an annulus section of $610$ deg$^2$, primarily in the southernhemisphere. The binary merges into a black hole of $62^{+4}_{-4} M_\odot$ andspin $0.67^{+0.05}_{-0.07}$. This black hole is significantly more massive thanany other inferred from electromagnetic observations in the stellar-massregime."

Evidence of theisospin-violating decay $\psi(3686)\to\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}\pi^0$ is found forthe first time with a statistical significance of $3.7\sigma$, the branchingfraction $\mathcal{B}(\psi(3686)\to\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}\pi^0)$ is measured tobe $(1.42\pm0.39\pm0.59)\times10^{-6}$, and its corresponding upper limit isdetermined to be $2.47\times10^{-6}$ at 90\% confidence level. A partial waveanalysis of $\psi(3686)\to\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}\eta$ shows that the peak around$\Lambda\eta$ invariant mass threshold favors a $\Lambda^*$ resonance with massand width in agreement with the $\Lambda(1670)$. The branching fraction of the$\psi(3686)\to\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}\eta$ is measured to be$(2.34\pm0.18\pm0.52)\times10^{-5}$. The first uncertainties are statisticaland the second are systematic.

Zou;2022/04/16;http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07800v3;The cross sections of $e^+e^- \rightarrow K^+K^-J/\psi$ at center-of-massenergies from 4.127 to 4.600~GeV are measured based on 15.6 fb$^{-1}$ datacollected with the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII storage ring. Tworesonant structures are observed in the line shape of the cross sections. Themass and width of the first structure are measured to be($4225.3\pm2.3\pm21.5$) MeV and ($72.9\pm6.1\pm30.8$)~MeV, respectively. Theyare consistent with those of the established $Y(4230)$. The second structure isobserved for the first time with a statistical significance greater than8$\sigma$, denoted as $Y(4500)$. Its mass and width are determined to be($4484.7\pm13.3\pm24.1$) MeV and ($111.1\pm30.1\pm15.2$) MeV, respectively. Thefirst presented uncertainties are statistical and the second ones aresystematic. The product of the electronic partial width with the decaybranching fraction $ \Gamma(Y(4230)\to e^+ e^-) \mathcal{B}(Y(4230) \to K^+ K^-J/\psi)$ is reported.

Zunica;2021/07/21;http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10090v3;The differential cross-section of prompt inclusive production of long-livedcharged particles in proton-proton collisions is measured using a data samplerecorded by the LHCb experiment at a centre-of-mass energy of ${\sqrt{s} =13\,\mathrm{TeV}}$. The data sample, collected with an unbiased trigger,corresponds to an integrated luminosity of ${5.4\,\mathrm{nb}^{-1}}$. Thedifferential cross-section is measured as a function of transverse momentum andpseudorapidity in the ranges ${p_\mathrm{T} \in [0.08,10)\,\mathrm{GeV}\,c^{-1}}$ and ${\eta \in [2.0, 4.8)}$ and is determinedseparately for positively and negatively charged particles. The results arecompared with predictions from various hadronic-interaction models.

Zunica;2021/08/20;http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09284v3;Branching fraction and effective lifetime measurements of the rare decay$B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ and searches for the decays $B^0\to\mu^+\mu^-$ and$B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-\gamma$ are reported using proton-proton collision datacollected with the LHCb detector at centre-of-mass energies of $7$ TeV, $8$ TeVand $13$ TeV, corresponding to a luminosity of $9$ fb$^{-1}$. The branchingfraction${\mathcal{B}}(B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-)=\left(3.09^{+0.46+0.15}_{-0.43-0.11}\right)\times10^{-9}$ and the effective lifetime $\tau(B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-)=(2.07\pm 0.29\pm0.03)$ are measured, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the secondsystematic. No significant signal for $B^0\to\mu^+\mu^-$ and$B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-\gamma$ decays is found and upper limits$\mathcal{B}(B^0\to\mu^+\mu^-)<2.6\times 10^{-10}$ and$\mathcal{B}(B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-\gamma)<2.0\times 10^{-9}$ at the 95% CL aredetermined, where the latter is limited to the range $m_{\mu\mu} > 4.9$GeV$/c^2$. The results are in agreement with the Standard Model expectations.

Zonca;2011/01/11;http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.2034v1;(abridged) We perform a detailed investigation of sources from the Cold CoresCatalogue of Planck Objects (C3PO). Our goal is to probe the reliability of thedetections, validate the separation between warm and cold dust emissioncomponents, provide the first glimpse at the nature, internal morphology andphysical characterictics of the Planck-detected sources. We focus on asub-sample of ten sources from the C3PO list, selected to sample differentenvironments, from high latitude cirrus to nearby (150pc) and remote (2kpc)molecular complexes. We present Planck surface brightness maps and derive thedust temperature, emissivity spectral index, and column densities of thefields. With the help of higher resolution Herschel and AKARI continuumobservations and molecular line data, we investigate the morphology of thesources and the properties of the substructures at scales below the Planck beamsize.

Zepeda;2021/02/15;http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07797v2;We present the first measurement of the fluctuations in the number of muonsin extensive air showers produced by ultrahigh energy cosmic rays. We find thatthe measured fluctuations are in good agreement with predictions from airshower simulations. This observation provides new insights into the origin ofthe previously reported deficit of muons in air shower simulations andconstrains models of hadronic interactions at ultrahigh energies. Ourmeasurement is compatible with the muon deficit originating from smalldeviations in the predictions from hadronic interaction models of particleproduction that accumulate as the showers develop.

Zou;2022/05/27;http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13759v4;The singly Cabibbo-suppressed decay $D_{s}^{+} \to K^+\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{0}$is observed, using a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 6.32$\rm fb^{-1}$ recorded by the BESIII detector at the centre-of-mass energiesbetween 4.178 and 4.226 GeV. The first amplitude analysis of $D_{s}^{+} \toK^+\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{0}$ reveals the sub-structures in this decay anddetermines the fractions and relative phases of different intermediateprocesses. The dominant intermediate process is $D_s^+ \to K^{*0}\rho^+$, witha fit fraction of $(40.5\pm2.8_{\rm{stat.}}\pm1.5_{\rm{syst.}})\%$. With thedetection efficiency based on our amplitude analysis, the absolute branchingfraction for $D_{s}^{+} \to K^+\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{0}$ is measured to be$(9.75\pm0.54_{\rm{stat.}}\pm0.17_{\rm{syst.}})\times 10^{-3}$.

Zhang;2016/11/17;http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05531v1;We present several studies of convolutional neural networks applied to datacoming from the MicroBooNE detector, a liquid argon time projection chamber(LArTPC). The algorithms studied include the classification of single particleimages, the localization of single particle and neutrino interactions in animage, and the detection of a simulated neutrino event overlaid with cosmic raybackgrounds taken from real detector data. These studies demonstrate thepotential of convolutional neural networks for particle identification or eventdetection on simulated neutrino interactions. We also address technical issuesthat arise when applying this technique to data from a large LArTPC at or nearground level.

Zuo;2021/04/11;http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04965v2;The Wide Field-of-View Cherenkov Telescope Array (WFCTA) and the WaterCherenkov Detector Arrays (WCDA) of LHAASO are designed to work in combinationfor measuring the energy spectra of various cosmic ray species over a very wideenergy range from a few TeV to 10 PeV. The energy calibration of WCDA can beachieved with a proven technique of measuring the westward shift of the Moonshadow of galactic cosmic rays due to the geomagnetic field. This deflectionangle $\Delta$ is inversely proportional to the energy of the cosmic rays. Theprecise measurements of the shifts by WCDA allows us to calibrate its energyscale for energies as high as 35 TeV. The energy scale measured by WCDA can beused to cross calibrate the energy reconstructed by WFCTA, which spans thewhole energy range up to 10 PeV. In this work, we will demonstrate thefeasibility of the method using the data collected from April 2019 to January2020 by the WFCTA array and WCDA-1 detector, the first of the three waterCherenkov ponds, already commissioned at LHAASO site.

Zhukov, J. B. Zonneveld, S. Zucchelli, D. Zuliani, G. Zunica;2021/03/11;http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06810v2;The ratio of the $B^0_s$ and $B^0$ fragmentation fractions, $f_s/f_d$, inproton-proton collisions at the LHC, is obtained as a function of $B$-mesontransverse momentum and collision centre-of-mass energy from the combinedanalysis of different $B$-decay channels measured by the LHCb experiment. Theresults are described by a linear function of the meson transverse momentum, orwith a function inspired by Tsallis statistics. Precise measurements of thebranching fractions of the $B^0_s \to J/\psi \phi$ and $B^0_s \to D^-_s \pi^+$decays are performed, reducing their uncertainty by about a factor of two withrespect to previous world averages. Numerous $B^0_s$ decay branching fractions,measured at the LHCb experiment, are also updated using the new values of$f_s/f_d$ and branching fractions of normalisation channels. These resultsreduce a major source of systematic uncertainty in several searches for newphysics performed through measurements of $B^0_s$ branching fractions.

Zou;2022/07/23;http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11483v3;Using $4.5~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$ annihilation data samples collectedat the center-of-mass energies ranging from 4.600~GeV to 4.699~GeV with theBESIII detector at the BEPCII collider, a first study of the semileptonicdecays $\Lambda_c^+\rightarrow pK^-e^+\nu_e$, $\Lambda_c^+\rightarrow\Lambda(1520) e^+\nu_e$ and $\Lambda_c^+\rightarrow \Lambda(1405) e^+\nu_e$ isperformed. The $\Lambda_c^+\rightarrow pK^-e^+\nu_e$ decay is observed with asignificance of $8.2\sigma$ and the branching fraction is measured to be$\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_c^+\rightarrow pK^- e^+\nu_e)=(0.88\pm0.17_{\rmstat.}\pm0.07_{\rm syst.})\times 10^{-3}$. We also report evidence of$\Lambda_c^+\rightarrow \Lambda(1520)e^+\nu_e$ and $\Lambda_c^+\rightarrow\Lambda(1405)e^+\nu_e$ with significances of $3.3\sigma$ and $3.2\sigma$,respectively, and measure $\mathcal B(\Lambda^+_c\rightarrow\Lambda(1520)e^+\nu_e)=(1.02\pm0.52_{\rm stat.}\pm0.11_{\rmsyst.})\times10^{-3}$ and $\mathcal B(\Lambda^+_c\rightarrow\Lambda(1405)[\rightarrow pK^-]e^+\nu_e)=(0.42\pm0.19_{\rm stat.}\pm0.04_{\rmsyst.})\times10^{-3}$. Combining these with the inclusive semileptonic$\Lambda_c^+$ branching fraction measured by BESIII, the relative fraction isdetermined to be $[\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_c^+\rightarrowpK^-e^+\nu_e)/\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_c^+\rightarrow X e^+\nu_e)]=(2.1\pm0.4_{\rmstat.}\pm0.2_{\rm syst.})\%$, which provides a clear confirmation thatsemileptonic $\Lambda_c^+$ decays are not saturated by the $\Lambda\ell^+\nu_{\ell}$ final state.

Zou, J. H. Zou;2022/06/28;http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13864v1;By analyzing $e^+e^-$ annihilation data with an integrated luminosity of$2.93~\rm fb^{-1}$ collected at the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt s=$ 3.773 GeVwith the BESIII detector, we present the first absolute measurements of thebranching fractions of twenty Cabibbo-suppressed hadronic $D^{0(+)}$ decaysinvolving multiple pions. The largest four branching fractions obtained are$\mathcal{B}(D^0\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0)= (1.343\pm0.013_{\rm stat}\pm0.016_{\rmsyst})\%$, $\mathcal{B}(D^0\to\pi^+\pi^-2\pi^0)= (0.998\pm0.019_{\rmstat}\pm0.024_{\rm syst})\%$, $\mathcal{B}(D^+\to 2\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0)=(1.174\pm0.021_{\rm stat}\pm0.021_{\rm syst})\%$, and $\mathcal{B}(D^+\to2\pi^+\pi^-2\pi^0)=(1.074\pm0.040_{\rm stat}\pm0.030_{\rm syst})\%$. The $CP$asymmetries for the six decays with highest event yields are also determined.

Zunica;2020/10/27;http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14485v2;Using a proton-proton collision data sample collected by the LHCb experiment,corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 8.5 fb$^{-1}$, the observation ofa new excited $\Xi_b^0$ resonance decaying to the $\Xi_b^-\pi^+$ final state ispresented. The state, referred to as $\Xi_b(6227)^0$, has a measured mass andnatural width of  $m(\Xi_b(6227)^0) = 6227.1^{\,+1.4}_{\,-1.5}\pm0.5$ MeV,  $\Gamma(\Xi_b(6227)^0) = 18.6^{\,+5.0}_{\,-4.1}\pm1.4$ MeV, where theuncertainties are statistical and systematic. The production rate of the$\Xi_b(6227)^0$ state relative to that of the $\Xi_b^-$ baryon in the kinematicregion $2<\eta<5$ and $p_{\rm T}<30$ GeV is measured to be  $\frac{f_{\Xi_b(6227)^0}}{f_{\Xi_b^-}}{\mathcal{B}}(\Xi_b(6227)^0\to\Xi_b^-\pi^+)= 0.045\pm0.008\pm0.004$, where ${\mathcal{B}}(\Xi_b(6227)^0\to\Xi_b^-\pi^+)$is the branching fraction of the decay, and $f_{\Xi_b(6227)^0}$ and$f_{\Xi_b^-}$ represent fragmentation fractions.  Improved measurements of the mass and natural width of the previouslyobserved $\Xi_b(6227)^-$ state, along with the mass of the $\Xi_b^-$ baryon,are also reported. Both measurements are significantly more precise than, andconsistent with, previously reported values.

Zonca;2015/09/22;http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06555v1;"We use Planck data to detect the cross-correlation between the thermalSunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect and the infrared emission from the galaxies thatmake up the the cosmic infrared background (CIB). We first perform a stackinganalysis towards Planck-confirmed galaxy clusters. We detect infrared emissionproduced by dusty galaxies inside these clusters and demonstrate that theinfrared emission is about 50% more extended than the tSZ effect. Modelling theemission with a Navarro--Frenk--White profile, we find that the radial profileconcentration parameter is $c_{500} = 1.00^{+0.18}_{-0.15}$. This indicatesthat infrared galaxies in the outskirts of clusters have higher infrared fluxthan cluster-core galaxies. We also study the cross-correlation between tSZ andCIB anisotropies, following three alternative approaches based on powerspectrum analyses: (i) using a catalogue of confirmed clusters detected inPlanck data; (ii) using an all-sky tSZ map built from Planck frequency maps;and (iii) using cross-spectra between Planck frequency maps. With the threedifferent methods, we detect the tSZ-CIB cross-power spectrum at significancelevels of (i) 6 $\sigma$, (ii) 3 $\sigma$, and (iii) 4 $\sigma$. We model thetSZ-CIB cross-correlation signature and compare predictions with themeasurements. The amplitude of the cross-correlation relative to the fiducialmodel is $A_{\rm tSZ-CIB}= 1.2\pm0.3$. This result is consistent withpredictions for the tSZ-CIB cross-correlation assuming the best-fitcosmological model from Planck 2015 results along with the tSZ and CIB scalingrelations."

Zucchelli, D. Zuliani, G. Zunica;2020/10/22;http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11802v2;The relative branching fractions of $B^+ \to h^+h^{\prime +}h^{\prime -}$decays, where $h^{(\prime)}$ is a pion or kaon, are measured. The analysis isperformed with a data sample, collected with the LHCb detector, correspondingto an integrated luminosity of $3.0 {\rm fb}^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisions. Theresults obtained improve significantly on previous measurements of thesequantities, and are important for the interpretation of Dalitz plot analyses ofthree-body charmless hadronic decays of $B^+$ mesons.

Zweizig";2017/11/18;http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06843v1;We present the results of a search for long-duration gravitational wavetransients in the data of the LIGO Hanford and LIGO Livingston secondgeneration detectors between September 2015 and January 2016, with a totalobservational time of 49 days. The search targets gravitational wave transientsof \unit[10 -- 500]{s} duration in a frequency band of \unit[24 -- 2048]{Hz},with minimal assumptions about the signal waveform, polarization, sourcedirection, or time of occurrence. No significant events were observed. %Allcandidate triggers were consistent with the expected background, As a result weset 90\% confidence upper limits on the rate of long-duration gravitationalwave transients for different types of gravitational wave signals. We also showthat the search is sensitive to sources in the Galaxy emitting at least $\sim$\unit[$10^{-8}$]{$\mathrm{M_{\odot} c^2}$} in gravitational waves.

Zou;2022/07/29;http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00099v1;"Using data samples collected with the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCIIstorage ring, we measure the cross sections of the$e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}D^{+}D^{-}$ process at center-of-massenergies from 4.190 to 4.946 GeV with a partial reconstruction method. Tworesonance structures are seen and the resonance parameters are determined froma fit to the cross section line shape. The first resonance we observe has amass of (4373.1 $\pm$ 4.0 $\pm$ 2.2) MeV/$c^2$ and a width of (146.5 $\pm$ 7.4$\pm$ 1.3) MeV, in agreement with those of the $Y(4390)$ state; the otherresonance has a mass of (4706 $\pm$ 11 $\pm$ 4) MeV/$c^2$, a width of (45 $\pm$28 $\pm$ 9) MeV, and a statistical significance of $4.1$ standard deviations($\sigma$). This is the first evidence for a vector state at this mass value.The spin-$3$ $D$-wave charmonium state $X(3842)$ is searched for through the$e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}X(3842)\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}D^{+}D^{-}$process, and evidence with a significance of $4.2\sigma$ is found in the datasamples with center-of-mass energies from 4.600 to 4.700 GeV."

Zou;2022/07/03;http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01004v1;Using a sample of $4.3\times 10^5$ $\eta'\to\eta\pi^0\pi^0$ events selectedfrom the 10 billion $J/\psi$ event data set collected with the BESIII detector,we study the decay $\eta'\to\eta\pi^0\pi^0$ within the framework ofnon-relativistic effective field theory. Evidence for a structure at$\pi^+\pi^-$ mass threshold is observed in the invariant mass spectrum of$\pi^0\pi^0$ with a statistical significance of around $3.5\sigma$, which isconsistent with the cusp effect as predicted by the non-relativistic effectivefield theory. After introducing the amplitude for describing the cusp effect,the $\pi\pi$ scattering length combination $a_0-a_2$ is determined to be$0.226\pm0.060_{stat.}\pm0.012_{syst.}$, which is in good agreement withtheoretical calculation of $0.2644\pm0.0051$.

Zweizig;2013/04/02;http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0670v11;We present our current best estimate of the plausible observing scenarios forthe Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and KAGRA gravitational-wave detectors overthe next several years, with the intention of providing information tofacilitate planning for multi-messenger astronomy with gravitational waves. Weestimate the sensitivity of the network to transient gravitational-wave signalsfor the third (O3), fourth (O4) and fifth observing (O5) runs, including theplanned upgrades of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. We studythe capability of the network to determine the sky location of the source forgravitational-wave signals from the inspiral of binary systems of compactobjects, that is BNS, NSBH, and BBH systems. The ability to localize thesources is given as a sky-area probability, luminosity distance, and comovingvolume. The median sky localization area (90\% credible region) is expected tobe a few hundreds of square degrees for all types of binary systems during O3with the Advanced LIGO and Virgo (HLV) network. The median sky localizationarea will improve to a few tens of square degrees during O4 with the AdvancedLIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (HLVK) network. We evaluate sensitivity and localizationexpectations for unmodeled signal searches, including the search forintermediate mass black hole binary mergers.

The resulting mapsincorporate the dominant instrumental, scanning, and data analysis effects;remaining subdominant effects will be included in future updates. Generated ata cost of some 25 million CPU-hours spread across multiplehigh-performance-computing (HPC) platforms, FFP8 is used for the validation andverification of analysis algorithms, as well as their implementations, and forremoving biases from and quantifying uncertainties in the results of analysesof the real data."

Thebranching fraction is measured to be B(B0->J/\psi K+K-) = (2.53 +/- 0.31 +/-0.19)x10^{-6}, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second issystematic. An amplitude analysis of the final state in the B0->J/\psi K+K-decay is performed to separate resonant and nonresonant contributions in theK+K- spectrum. Evidence of the a0(980) resonance is reported with statisticalsignificance of 3.9 standard deviations. The corresponding product branchingfraction is measured to be B(B0->J/\psi a0(980), a0(980)->K+K-)=(4.70 +/- 3.31+/- 0.72)x10^{-7}, yielding an upper limit of B(B0->J/\psi a0(980),a0(980)->K+K-)<9.0x10^{-7} at 90% confidence level.

Zverev;2010/09/14;http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.2731v2;Decays of b hadrons into final states containing a D0 meson and a muon areused to measure the b anti-b production cross-section in proton-protoncollisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV at the LHC. In thepseudorapidity interval 2 < eta < 6 and integrated over all transverse momentawe find that the average cross-section to produce b-flavoured oranti-b-flavoured hadrons is (75.3 +/- 5.4 +/- 13.0) microbarns.

Zunica;2021/08/20;http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09283v3;An improved measurement of the decay $B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ and searches forthe decays $B^0\to\mu^+\mu^-$ and $B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-\gamma$ are performed atthe LHCb experiment using data collected in proton-proton collisions at$\sqrt{s} = 7,~8$ and $13$ TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 1,2 and 6 fb$^{-1}$, respectively. The $B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ branching fractionand effective lifetime are measured to be${\mathcal{B}}(B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-)=\left(3.09^{+0.46+0.15}_{-0.43-0.11}\right)\times10^{-9}$ and $\tau(B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-)=(2.07\pm 0.29\pm 0.03)$ ps,respectively, where the uncertainties include both statistical and systematiccontributions. No significant signal for $B^0\to\mu^+\mu^-$ and$B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-\gamma$ decays is found and the upper limits$\mathcal{B}(B^0\to\mu^+\mu^-)<2.6\times 10^{-10}$ and$\mathcal{B}(B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-\gamma)<2.0\times 10^{-9}$ at 95% confidencelevel are determined, where the latter is limited to the range $m_{\mu\mu} >4.9$ GeV$/c^2$. Additionally, the ratio between the $B^0\to\mu^+\mu^-$ and$B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ branching fractions is measured to be$\mathcal{R}_{\mu^+\mu^-}<0.095$ at 95% confidence level. The results are inagreement with the Standard Model predictions.

Zweizig";2016/12/06;http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02029v3;A wide variety of astrophysical and cosmological sources are expected tocontribute to a stochastic gravitational-wave background. Following theobservations of GW150914 and GW151226, the rate and mass of coalescing binaryblack holes appear to be greater than many previous expectations. As a result,the stochastic background from unresolved compact binary coalescences isexpected to be particularly loud. We perform a search for the isotropicstochastic gravitational-wave background using data from Advanced LIGO's firstobserving run. The data display no evidence of a stochastic gravitational-wavesignal. We constrain the dimensionless energy density of gravitational waves tobe $\Omega_0<1.7\times 10^{-7}$ with 95% confidence, assuming a flat energydensity spectrum in the most sensitive part of the LIGO band (20-86 Hz). Thisis a factor of ~33 times more sensitive than previous measurements. We alsoconstrain arbitrary power-law spectra. Finally, we investigate the implicationsof this search for the background of binary black holes using an astrophysicalmodel for the background.

Zu;2022/09/18;http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08464v3;Based on $e^+e^-$ collision samples corresponding to an integrated luminosityof 4.4 $\mbox{fb$^{-1}$}$ collected with the BESIII detector at center-of-massenergies between $4.6\,\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and $4.7\,\,\mathrm{GeV}$, a partialwave analysis of the charmed baryon hadronic decay$\Lambda_c^+\to\Lambda\pi^+\pi^0$ is performed, and the decays$\Lambda_c^+\to\Lambda\rho(770)^{+}$ and $\Lambda_c^+\to\Sigma(1385)\pi$ arestudied for the first time. Making use of the world-average branching fraction$\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_c^+\to\Lambda\pi^+\pi^0)$, their branching fractions aredetermined to be \begin{eqnarray*} \begin{aligned}\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_c^+\to\Lambda\rho(770)^+)=&(4.06\pm0.30\pm0.35\pm0.23)\times10^{-2},\\\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_c^+\to\Sigma(1385)^+\pi^0)=&(5.86\pm0.49\pm0.52\pm0.35)\times10^{-3},\\\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_c^+\to\Sigma(1385)^0\pi^+)=&(6.47\pm0.59\pm0.66\pm0.38)\times10^{-3},\\\end{aligned} \end{eqnarray*} where the first uncertainties are statistical,the second are systematic, and the third are from the uncertainties of thebranching fractions $\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_c^+\to\Lambda\pi^+\pi^0)$ and$\mathcal{B}(\Sigma(1385)\to\Lambda\pi)$. In addition, %according to amplitudesdetermined from the partial wave analysis, the decay asymmetry parameters aremeasured to be $\alpha_{\Lambda\rho(770)^+}=-0.763\pm0.053\pm0.045$,$\alpha_{\Sigma(1385)^{+}\pi^0}=-0.917\pm0.069\pm0.056$, and$\alpha_{\Sigma(1385)^{0}\pi^+}=-0.789\pm0.098\pm0.056$.

Seader;2011/10/01;http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.0135v1;Having started science operations in May 2009, the Kepler photometer has beenable to provide exquisite data of solar-like stars. Five out of the 42 starsobserved continuously during the survey phase show evidence of oscillations,even though they are rather faint (magnitudes from 10.5 to 12). In this paper,we present an overview of the results of the seismic analysis of 4 of thesestars observed during more than eight months.

Zunica;2020/12/23;http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12789v2;A measurement of direct CP violation in the decay $B^{+} \rightarrow K^{+}\pi^{0}$ is reported using a data sample corresponding to an integratedluminosity of 5.4 $\textrm{fb}^{-1}$, collected with the LHCb experiment at acenter-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. The CP asymmetry is measured to be$0.025 \pm 0.015 \pm 0.006 \pm 0.003$, where the uncertainties are statistical,systematic, and due to an external input, respectively. This is the mostprecise measurement of the CP asymmetry in the decay $B^{+} \rightarrow K^{+}\pi^{0}$ and exceeds the precision on the current world average. This direct CPasymmetry is a key input to studies of a long-standing anomaly in $B$ mesondecays, known as the $K\pi$-puzzle. The asymmetry is consistent with theprevious measurements of this quantity, confirming and significantly enhancingthe observed anomalous difference between the direct CP asymmetries of the$B^{0} \rightarrow K^{+} \pi^{-}$ and $B^{+} \rightarrow K^{+} \pi^{0}$ decays.

Zou, J. H. Zou;2022/09/28;http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13893v1;We report a search for a dark photon using $14.9$ fb$^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$annihilation data taken at center-of-mass energies from 4.13 to 4.60 GeV withthe BESIII detector operated at the BEPCII storage ring. The dark photon isassumed to be produced in the initial state radiation process and topredominantly decay into light dark matter particles, which escape from thedetector undetected. The mass range from 1.5 to 2.9 GeV$/c^2$ is scanned forthe dark photon candidate, and no significant signal is observed. The massdependent upper limits at the 90$\%$ confidence level on the coupling strengthparameter $\epsilon$ for a dark photon coupling with an ordinary photon varybetween $1.6\times 10^{-3}$ and $5.7\times10^{-3}$.

Zucchelli, D. Zuliani, G. Zunica;2020/12/17;http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09903v2;Measurements of $C\!P$ observables in $B^\pm \rightarrow D^{(*)} K^\pm$ and$B^\pm \rightarrow D^{(*)} \pi^\pm$ decays are presented, where $D^{(*)}$indicates a neutral $D$ or $D^*$ meson that is an admixture of meson andanti-meson states. Decays of the $D^*$ meson to the $D\pi^0$ and $D\gamma$final states are partially reconstructed without inclusion of the neutral pionor photon. Decays of the $D$ meson are reconstructed in the $K^\pm \pi^\mp$,$K^+K^-$, and $\pi^+\pi^-$ final states. The analysis uses a sample of charged$B$ mesons produced in proton-proton collisions and collected with the LHCbexperiment, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 2.0, 1.0, and 5.7fb$^{-1}$ taken at centre-of-mass energies of 7, 8, and 13 TeV, respectively.The measurements of partially reconstructed $B^\pm \to D^* K^\pm$ and $B^\pm\to D^* \pi^\pm$ with $D \to K^\mp \pi^\pm$ decays are the first of their kind,and a first observation of the $B^\pm \to (D \pi^0)_{D^*} \pi^\pm$ decay ismade with a significance of 6.1 standard deviations. All $C\!P$ observables aremeasured with world-best precision, and in combination with other LHCb resultswill provide strong constraints on the CKM angle $\gamma$.

A strong deviation ($>$ 30$\sigma$) fromthree-body $\jpsi\to\gamma\omega\phi$ phase space is observed near the$\omega\phi$ mass threshold that is consistent with a previous observationreported by the BESII experiment. A partial wave analysis with a tensorcovariant amplitude that assumes that the enhancement is due to the presence ofa resonance, the X(1810), is performed, and confirms that the spin-parity ofthe X(1810) is $0^{++}$. The mass and width of the X(1810) are determined to be$M=1795\pm7$(stat)$^{+13}_{-5}$(syst)$\pm$19(mod) MeV/$c^2$ and$\Gamma=95\pm10$(stat)$^{+21}_{-34}$(syst)$\pm$75(mod) MeV/$c^2$, respectively,and the product branching fraction is measured to be ${\cal B}(\jpsi\to\gammaX(1810))\times{\calB}(X(1810)\to\of)=(2.00\pm0.08$(stat)$^{+0.45}_{-1.00}$(syst)$\pm$1.30(mod))$\times10^{-4}$.%where the first error is the statistical error and the second the systematicalerror. These results are consistent within errors with those of the BESIIexperiment.

Zwaska;2019/09/07;http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03351v1;This paper presents measurements of production cross sections and inelasticcross sections for the following reactions: 60 GeV/$c$ protons with C, Be, Altargets and 120 GeV/$c$ protons with C and Be targets. The analysis wasperformed using the NA61/SHINE spectrometer at the CERN SPS. First measurementswere obtained using protons at 120 GeV/$c$, while the results for protons at 60GeV/$c$ were compared with previously published measurements. These interactioncross section measurements are critical inputs for neutrino flux prediction incurrent and future accelerator-based long-baseline neutrino experiments.

Zunica;2021/05/06;http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02596v2;The first full angular analysis of the $B^0 \to D^{*-} D_s^{*+}$ decay isperformed using 6 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collision data collected with the LHCbexperiment at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The $D_s^{*+} \to D_s^+\gamma$ and $D^{*-} \to \bar{D}^0 \pi^-$ vector meson decays are used with thesubsequent $D_s^+ \to K^+ K^- \pi^+$ and $\bar{D}^0 \to K^+ \pi^-$ decays. Allhelicity amplitudes and phases are measured, and the longitudinal polarisationfraction is determined to be $f_{\rm L} = 0.578 \pm 0.010 \pm 0.011$ withworld-best precision, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the secondis systematic. The pattern of helicity amplitude magnitudes is found to alignwith expectations from quark-helicity conservation in $B$ decays. The ratio ofbranching fractions $[\mathcal{B}(B^0 \to D^{*-} D_s^{*+}) \times\mathcal{B}(D_s^{*+} \to D_s^+ \gamma)]/\mathcal{B}(B^0 \to D^{*-} D_s^+)$ ismeasured to be $2.045 \pm 0.022 \pm 0.071$ with world-best precision. Inaddition, the first observation of the Cabibbo-suppressed $B_s^0 \to D^{*-}D_s^+$ decay is made with a significance of seven standard deviations. Thebranching fraction ratio $\mathcal{B}(B_s^0 \to D^{*-} D_s^+)/\mathcal{B}(B^0\to D^{*-} D_s^+)$ is measured to be $0.049 \pm 0.006 \pm 0.003 \pm 0.002$,where the third uncertainty is due to limited knowledge of the ratio offragmentation fractions.

Zou, J. H. Zou;2022/05/10;http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04809v2;From December 2019 to June 2021, the BESIII experiment collected about 5.85fb$^{-1}$ of data at center-of-mass energies between 4.61 GeV and 4.95 GeV.This is the highest collision energy BEPCII has reached so far. The accumulated$e^+e^-$ annihilation data samples are useful for studying charmonium(-like)states and charmed-hadron decays. By adopting a novel method of analyzing theproduction of $\Lambda_{c}^{+}\bar{\Lambda}_{c}^{-}$ pairs in $e^+e^-$annihilation, the center-of-mass energies are measured with a precision of$\sim$0.6 MeV. Integrated luminosities are measured with a precision of betterthan 1\% by analyzing the events of large-angle Bhabha scattering. Thesemeasurements provide important inputs to the analyses based on these datasamples.

Zou;2022/09/24;http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12007v1;We report a measurement of the cross section for the process$e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-J/\psi$ around the $X(3872)$ mass in search for the directformation of $e^+e^-\to X(3872)$ through the two-photon fusion process. Noenhancement of the cross section is observed at the $X(3872)$ peak and an upperlimit on the product of electronic width and branching fraction of$X(3872)\to\pi^+\pi^-J/\psi$ is determined to be$\Gamma_{ee}\times\mathcal{B}(X(3872)\to\pi^+\pi^-J/\psi)<7.5\times10^{-3}\,\text{eV}$at $90\,\%$ confidence level under an assumption of total width of$1.19\pm0.21$ MeV. This is an improvement of a factor of about $17$ compared tothe previous limit. Furthermore, using the latest result of$\mathcal{B}(X(3872)\to\pi^+\pi^-J/\psi)$, an upper limit on the electronicwidth $\Gamma_{ee}$ of $X(3872)$ is obtained to be $<0.32\,\text{eV}$ at the$90\,\%$ confidence level.

Wandelt, M. White, D. Yvon, A. Zacchei, A. Zonca;2013/11/07;http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.1657v2;We explore the 2013 Planck likelihood function with a high-precisionmulti-dimensional minimizer (Minuit). This allows a refinement of theLambda-cdm best-fit solution with respect to previously-released results, andthe construction of frequentist confidence intervals using profile likelihoods.The agreement with the cosmological results from the Bayesian framework isexcellent, demonstrating the robustness of the Planck results to thestatistical methodology. We investigate the inclusion of neutrino masses, wheremore significant differences may appear due to the non-Gaussian nature of theposterior mass distribution. By applying the Feldman--Cousins prescription, weagain obtain results very similar to those of the Bayesian methodology.However, the profile-likelihood analysis of the CMB combination(Planck+WP+highL) reveals a minimum well within the unphysical negative-massregion. We show that inclusion of the Planck CMB-lensing informationregularizes this issue, and provide a robust frequentist upper limit $M_\nu <0.26 eV$ ($95%$ confidence) from the CMB+lensing+BAO data combination.

Zlochower;2016/02/11;http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03841v3;The LIGO detection of GW150914 provides an unprecedented opportunity to studythe two-body motion of a compact-object binary in the large velocity, highlynonlinear regime, and to witness the final merger of the binary and theexcitation of uniquely relativistic modes of the gravitational field. We carryout several investigations to determine whether GW150914 is consistent with abinary black-hole merger in general relativity. We find that the finalremnant's mass and spin, as determined from the low-frequency (inspiral) andhigh-frequency (post-inspiral) phases of the signal, are mutually consistentwith the binary black-hole solution in general relativity. Furthermore, thedata following the peak of GW150914 are consistent with the least-dampedquasi-normal mode inferred from the mass and spin of the remnant black hole. Byusing waveform models that allow for parameterized general-relativityviolations during the inspiral and merger phases, we perform quantitative testson the gravitational-wave phase in the dynamical regime and we determine thefirst empirical bounds on several high-order post-Newtonian coefficients. Weconstrain the graviton Compton wavelength, assuming that gravitons aredispersed in vacuum in the same way as particles with mass, obtaining a$90\%$-confidence lower bound of $10^{13}$ km. In conclusion, within ourstatistical uncertainties, we find no evidence for violations of generalrelativity in the genuinely strong-field regime of gravity.

Zou;2022/06/22;http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10791v1;The radiative hyperon decay $\Lambda\to n\gamma$ is studied using$(10087\pm44)\times 10^6$ $J/\psi$ events collected with the BESIII detectoroperating at BEPCII. The absolute branching fraction of the decay $\Lambda\ton\gamma$ is determined with a significance of 5.6$\sigma$ to be$[0.832\pm0.038(\rm stat.)\pm0.054(\rm syst.)]\times10^{-3}$, which liessignificantly below the current PDG value. By analyzing the joint angulardistribution of the decay products, the first determination of the decayasymmetry $\alpha_{\gamma}$ is reported with a value of $-0.16\pm0.10(\rmstat.)\pm0.05(\rm syst.)$.

Zou;2022/11/24;http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13390v1;Using data taken at 29 center-of-mass energies between 4.16 and 4.70 GeV withthe BESIII detector at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider corresponding toa total integrated luminosity of approximately 18.8 $\rm fb^{-1}$, the process$e^+e^- \to p p \bar{p} \bar{n} \pi^{-} + c.c.$ is observed for the first timewith a statistical significance of $11.5\sigma$. The average Born crosssections in the energy ranges of (4.160, 4.380) GeV, (4.400, 4.600) GeV and(4.610, 4.700) GeV are measured to be $(21.5\pm5.7\pm1.2)$ fb,$(46.3\pm10.6\pm2.5)$ fb and $(59.0\pm9.4\pm3.2)$ fb, respectively, where thefirst uncertainties are statistical and the second are systematic. The lineshapes of the $\bar{p}\bar{n}$ and $pp\pi^-$ invariant mass spectra areconsistent with phase space distributions, indicating that no hexaquark ordi-baryon state is observed.

Zou, J. H. Zou;2022/04/23;http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11058v3;Based on 10 billion $J/\psi$ events collected at the BESIII experiment, asearch for $CP$ violation in $\Lambda$ decay is performed in the differencebetween $CP$-odd decay parameters $\alpha_{-}$ for $\Lambda \rightarrow p\pi^-$and $\alpha_{+}$ for $\bar\Lambda \rightarrow \bar{p}\pi^+$ by using theprocess $e^+e^- \to J/\psi \rightarrow \Lambda \bar\Lambda $. With afive-dimensional fit to the full angular distributions of the daughter baryon,the most precise values for the decay parameters are determined to be$\alpha_{-} = 0.7519 \pm 0.0036 \pm 0.0024$ and $\alpha_{+} = -0.7559 \pm0.0036 \pm 0.0030$, respectively. The $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ averagedvalue of the decay parameter is extracted to be $\alpha_{\rm{avg}} = 0.7542 \pm0.0010 \pm 0.0024$ with unprecedented accuracy. The $CP$ asymmetry$A_{CP}=(\alpha_{-}+\alpha_{+})/(\alpha_{-}-\alpha_{+})$ is determined to be$-0.0025 \pm 0.0046 \pm 0.0012$, which is one of the most precise measurementsin the baryon sector. The reported results for the decay parameter will play animportant role in the studies of the polarizations and $CP$ violations for thestrange, charmed and beauty baryons.

No excess of signal abovebackground is observed; we therefore set an upper limit on the branchingfraction of $\mathcal{B}(J/\psi\to e^{\pm}\mu^{\mp})<4.5\times10^{-9}$ at the$90\%$ confidence level. Improving the previous best result by a factor of morethan 30, this measurement places the most stringent limit to date on leptonflavor violation in the heavy quarkonium sector."

Zuo;2020/12/29;http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14622v2;The focal plane camera is the core component of the Wide Field-of-viewCherenkov/fluorescence Telescope Array (WFCTA) of the Large High-Altitude AirShower Observatory (LHAASO). Because of the capability of working undermoonlight without aging, silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) have been proven to benot only an alternative but also an improvement to conventional photomultipliertubes (PMT) in this application. Eighteen SiPM-based cameras with square lightfunnels have been built for WFCTA. The telescopes have collected more than 100million cosmic ray events and preliminary results indicate that these camerasare capable of working under moonlight. The characteristics of the lightfunnels and SiPMs pose challenges (e.g. dynamic range, dark count rate,assembly techniques). In this paper, we present the design features,manufacturing techniques and performances of these cameras. Finally, the testfacilities, the test methods and results of SiPMs in the cameras are reportedhere.

Zou;2022/06/28;http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13870v1;We present the first search for the semileptonic decay $D_s^+\to \pi^0e^+\nu_e$ using a data sample of electron-positron collisions recorded with theBESIII detector at center-of-mass energies between 4.178 and 4.226~GeV,corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 6.32~fb$^{-1}$. This decay isexpected to be sensitive to $\pi^0$--$\eta$ mixing. No significant signal isobserved. We set an upper limit of $6.4 \times 10^{-5}$ on the branchingfraction at the $90\%$ confidence level.

Zou;2022/07/22;http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10906v1;Based on a sample of 4.4 $\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation datacollected in the energy region between 4.6 GeV and 4.7 GeV with the BESIIIdetector at BEPCII, two singly Cabibbo-suppressed decays $\Lambda_c^+\rightarrow \Sigma^0 K^+$ and $\Lambda_{c}^{+} \rightarrow \Sigma^+ K_{S}^0$are studied. The ratio of the branching fraction $\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_c^+\rightarrow \Sigma^0 K^+)$ relative to $\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_c^+ \rightarrow\Sigma^0 \pi^+)$ is measured to be $0.0361 \pm 0.0073(\mathrm{stat.}) \pm0.0005(\mathrm{syst.})$, and the ratio of $\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_c^+ \rightarrow\Sigma^+ K_{S}^0)$ relative to $\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_{c}^{+} \rightarrow\Sigma^+ \pi^+ \pi^-)$ is measured to be $0.0106 \pm 0.0031(\mathrm{stat.}) \pm0.0004(\mathrm{syst.})$. After taking the world-average branching fractions ofthe reference decay channels, the branching fractions $\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_c^+\rightarrow \Sigma^0 K^+)$ and $\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_{c}^{+} \rightarrow\Sigma^+ K_{S}^0)$ are determined to be $(4.7\pm 0.9(\mathrm{stat.})\pm0.1(\mathrm{syst.}) \pm 0.3(\mathrm{ref.}))\times10^{-4}$ and $(4.8\pm1.4(\mathrm{stat.})\pm 0.2(\mathrm{syst.}) \pm0.3(\mathrm{ref.}))\times10^{-4}$, respectively.

Zunica;2021/06/07;http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03744v2;A measurement of mixing and $C\!P$ violation in neutral charm mesons isperformed using data reconstructed in proton-proton collisions collected by theLHCb experiment from 2016 to 2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of5.4$\textrm{fb}^{-1}$. A total of $30.6$ million $D^{0}\rightarrowK^{0}_{\mathrm{S}}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ decays are analyzed using a method optimizedfor the measurement of the mass difference between neutral charm-mesoneigenstates. Allowing for $C\!P$ violation in mixing and in the interferencebetween mixing and decay, the mass and decay-width differences are measured tobe $x_{C\!P} = \left[3.97\pm0.46\textrm{(stat)}\pm0.29\textrm{(syst)}\right]\times10^{-3}$ and $y_{C\!P} =\left[4.59\pm1.20\textrm{(stat)}\pm0.85\textrm{(syst)}\right]\times10^{-3}$,respectively. The $C\!P$-violating parameters are measured as $\Delta x =\left[-0.27\pm0.18\textrm{(stat)}\pm0.01\textrm{(syst)}\right]\times10^{-3}$and $\Delta y =\left[0.20\pm0.36\textrm{(stat)}\pm0.13\textrm{(syst)}\right]\times10^{-3}$.This is the first observation of a nonzero mass difference in the $D^0$ mesonsystem, with a significance exceeding seven standard deviations. The data areconsistent with $C\!P$ symmetry, and improve existing constraints on theassociated parameters.

Zou;2022/06/24;http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12255v1;By analyzing $(448.1\pm2.9)\times10^6$ $\psi(3686)$ events collected with theBESIII detector operating at the BEPCII collider, the decays of $\chi_{cJ} \to\Lambda\bar \Lambda \eta$ ($J=0$, 1 and 2) are observed for the first time withstatistical significances of $13.9\sigma$, $6.7\sigma$, and $8.2\sigma$,respectively. The product branching fractions of $\psi(3686)\to\gamma\chi_{cJ}$and $\chi_{cJ}\to \Lambda\bar \Lambda \eta$ are measured. Dividing by the worldaverages of the branching fractions of $\psi(3686)\to\gamma\chi_{cJ}$, thebranching fractions of $\chi_{cJ}\to \Lambda\bar \Lambda \eta$ decays aredetermined to be $(2.31\pm0.30\pm0.21)\times10^{-4}$,$(5.86\pm1.38\pm0.68)\times10^{-5}$, and $(1.05\pm0.21\pm0.15)\times10^{-4}$for $J=0$, 1 and 2, respectively, where the first uncertainties are statisticaland the second systematic.

Zvyagin;2013/08/21;http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.4544v2;The result of a search for the decay Bc+ -> Bs0 pi+ is presented, using theBs0 -> Ds- pi+ and Bs0 -> J/psi Phi channels. The analysis is based on a datasample of pp collisions collected with the LHCb detector, corresponding to anintegrated luminosity of 1 fb-1 taken at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, and2 fb-1 taken at 8 TeV. The decay Bc+ -> Bs0 pi+ is observed with significancein excess of five standard deviations independently in both decay channels. Themeasured product of the ratio of cross-sections and branching fraction issigma(Bc+)/sigma(Bs0) x BR(Bc+ -> Bs0 pi+) = (2.37 \pm 0.31 (stat) \pm 0.11(syst)^{+0.17}_{-0.13} (tau_Bc)) x 10^-3 in the pseudorapidity range 2 < eta(B)< 5, where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic andthe third is due to the uncertainty on the Bc lifetime. This is the firstobservation of a B meson decaying to another B meson via the weak interaction.

Zunica;2021/04/30;http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.15074v2;A search for $CP$ violation in charmless three-body $\Xi_b^- \to p K^- K^-$decays is performed using $pp$ collision data recorded with the LHCb detector,corresponding to integrated luminosities of $1\,\text{fb}^{-1}$ at acentre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 7\,\text{TeV}$, $2\,\text{fb}^{-1}$ at$\sqrt{s} = 8\,\text{TeV}$ and $2\,\text{fb}^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s} =13\,\text{TeV}$. A good description of the phase-space distribution is obtainedwith an amplitude model containing contributions from $\Sigma(1385)$,$\Lambda(1405)$, $\Lambda(1520)$, $\Lambda(1670)$, $\Sigma(1775)$ and$\Sigma(1915)$ resonances. The model allows for $CP$-violation effects, whichare found to be consistent with zero. The branching fractions of $\Xi_b^- \to\Sigma(1385) K^-$, $\Xi_b^- \to \Lambda(1405) K^-$, $\Xi_b^- \to \Lambda(1520)K^-$, $\Xi_b^- \to \Lambda(1670) K^-$, $\Xi_b^- \to \Sigma(1775) K^-$ and$\Xi_b^- \to \Sigma(1915) K^-$ decays are also reported. In addition, an upperlimit is placed on the product of ratios of $\Omega_b^-$ and $\Xi_b^-$fragmentation fractions and the $\Omega_b^- \to p K^- K^-$ and $\Xi_b^- \to pK^- K^-$ branching fractions.

Zunica;2021/05/28;http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14007v2;The branching fraction of the rare $B^0_s\rightarrow\phi\mu^+\mu^-$ decay ismeasured using data collected by the LHCb experiment at center-of-mass energiesof $7$, $8$ and $13\,\rm{TeV}$, corresponding to integrated luminosities of$1$, $2$ and $6\,{\rm fb}^{-1}$, respectively. The branching fraction isreported in intervals of $q^2$, the square of the dimuon invariant mass. In the$q^2$ region between $1.1$ and $6.0\,{\rm Ge\kern -0.1em V}^2\!/c^4$, themeasurement is found to lie $3.6$ standard deviations below a Standard Modelprediction based on a combination of Light Cone Sum Rule and Lattice QCDcalculations. In addition, the first observation of the rare $B^0_s\rightarrowf_2^\prime(1525)\mu^+\mu^-$ decay is reported with a statistical significanceof nine standard deviations and its branching fraction is determined.

Zou;2022/06/22;http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10900v2;Using a sample of $(448.1~\pm~2.9)$ $\times 10^{6}$ $\psi(3686)$ decayscollected with the BESIII detector at BEPCII, we report an observation of$\Xi^{-}$ transverse polarization with a significance of $7.3 \sigma$ in thedecay $\psi(3686)\rightarrow\Xi^{-}\bar\Xi^{+}$($\Xi^{-}\rightarrow\pi^{-}\Lambda$,$\bar\Xi^{+}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\bar\Lambda$, $\Lambda\to p\pi^{-}$,$\bar\Lambda\to\bar{p}\pi^{+}$). The relative phase of the electric andmagnetic form factors is determined to be $\Delta\Phi = (0.667 \pm 0.111 \pm0.058)$ rad. This is the first measurement of the relative phase for a$\psi(3686)$ decay into a pair of $\Xi^{-}\bar\Xi^{+}$ hyperons. The $\Xi^{-}$decay parameters ($\alpha_{\Xi^{-}}$, $\phi_{\Xi^-}$) and their conjugates($\alpha_{\bar\Xi^{+}}$, $\phi_{\bar{\Xi}^{+}}$), the angular-distributionparameter $\alpha_{\psi}$, and the strong-phase difference$\delta_{p}-\delta_{s}$ for $\Lambda$-$\pi^-$ scattering are measured to beconsistent with previous BESIII results.

Zunica;2021/07/07;http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03419v2;The first observation of the $\Omega_b^- \to \Xi_c^+ K^- \pi^-$ decay isreported using $pp$ collision data at centre-of-mass energies of 7, 8 and13\,$\mathrm{TeV}$ collected by the LHCb experiment, corresponding to anintegrated luminosity of 9\,$\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. Four excited $\Omega_c^0$baryons are observed in the $\Xi_c^+ K^-$ mass projection of the $\Omega_b^-\to \Xi_c^+ K^- \pi^-$ decays with the significance of each exceeding fivestandard deviations. They coincide with the states previously observed inprompt \proton\proton and $e^+e^-$ production. Relative production rates,masses and natural widths of the states are measured, and a test of spinhypotheses is performed. Moreover, the branching ratio of $\Omega_b^- \to\Xi_c^+ K^- \pi^-$ is measured relative to the $\Omega_b^- \to \Omega_c^0\pi^-$ decay mode and a precise measurement of the $\Omega_b^-$ mass of\mbox{$6044.3 \pm 1.2 \pm 1.1^{\,+0.19}_{\,-0.22}\,\mathrm{MeV}$} is obtained.

We confirm that the double-feature at$H_{c}$ is robust without further splitting for temperatures below 1.8 K downto 0.48 K. The metamagnetism in Sr$_{4}$Ru$_{3}$O$_{10}$ is accompanied by areduction of the magnetic moment in the plane of rotation and largefield-hysteretic behavior. The double anomaly shifts to higher fields byrotating the field from $H\,\perp \,c$ to $H\,\parallel\,c$. We compare ourexperimental findings with numerical simulations based on spin reorientationmodels caused by intrinsic magnetocrystalline anisotropy and Zeeman effect.Crystal anisotropy is able to explain a metamagnetic transition in theferromagnetic ordered system Sr$_{4}$Ru$_{3}$O$_{10}$, but aDzyaloshinskii-Moriya term is crucial to account for a reduction of themagnetic moment as discovered in the experiments.

Zunica;2021/03/02;http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01803v2;The first observation of exotic states with a new quark content $c \bar{c} u\bar{s}$ decaying to the $J/\psi K^+$ final state is reported with highsignificance from an amplitude analysis of the $B^+ \to J/\psi \phi K^+$ decay.The analysis is carried out using proton-proton collision data corresponding toa total integrated luminosity of 9 fb$^{-1}$ collected by the LHCb experimentat centre-of-mass energies of 7, 8 and 13 TeV. The most significant state,$Z_{cs}(4000)^+$, has a mass of $4003\pm6\,^{+\,\phantom{0}4}_{-\,14}$ MeV, awidth of $131\pm15\pm26$ MeV, and spin-parity $J^P=1^+$, where the quoteduncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively. A new $1^+$$X(4685)$ state decaying to the $J/\psi \phi$ final state is also observed withhigh significance. In addition, the four previously reported $J/\psi \phi$states are confirmed and two more exotic states, $Z_{cs}(4220)^+$ and$X(4630)$, are observed with significance exceeding five standard deviations.

Zunica;2021/03/22;http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11769v2;The Standard Model of particle physics currently provides our bestdescription of fundamental particles and their interactions. The theorypredicts that the different charged leptons, the electron, muon and tau, haveidentical electroweak interaction strengths. Previous measurements have shown awide range of particle decays are consistent with this principle of leptonuniversality. This article presents evidence for the breaking of leptonuniversality in beauty-quark decays, with a significance of 3.1 standarddeviations, based on proton-proton collision data collected with the LHCbdetector at CERN's Large Hadron Collider. The measurements are of processes inwhich a beauty meson transforms into a strange meson with the emission ofeither an electron and a positron, or a muon and an antimuon. If confirmed byfuture measurements, this violation of lepton universality would imply physicsbeyond the Standard Model, such as a new fundamental interaction between quarksand leptons.

Zvyagin;2013/08/30;http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.6729v4;The production of $J/\psi$ mesons with rapidity $1.5<y<4.0$ or $-5.0<y<-2.5$and transverse momentum $p_\mathrm{T}<14 \mathrm{GeV}/c$ is studied with theLHCb detector in proton-lead collisions at a nucleon-nucleon centre-of-massenergy $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5 \mathrm{TeV}$. The analysis is based on a data samplecorresponding to an integrated luminosity of about $1.6 \mathrm{nb}^{-1}$. Forthe first time the nuclear modification factor and forward-backward productionratio are determined separately for prompt $J/\psi$ mesons and $J/\psi$ from$b$-hadron decays. Clear suppression of prompt $J/\psi$ production with respectto proton-proton collisions at large rapidity is observed, while the productionof $J/\psi$ from $b$-hadron decays is less suppressed. These results show goodagreement with available theoretical predictions. The measurement shows thatcold nuclear matter effects are important for interpretations of the relatedquark-gluon plasma signatures in heavy-ion collisions.

Zunica;2020/12/18;http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10380v2;First evidence of a structure in the $J/\psi \varLambda$ invariant massdistribution is obtained from an amplitude analysis of $\varXi_b^- \to J/\psi\varLambda K^-$ decays. The observed structure is consistent with being due toa charmonium pentaquark with strangeness. Its mass and width are determined tobe $4458.8\pm2.9\,^{+4.7}_{-1.1}$MeV and $17.3\pm6.5\,^{+8.0}_{-5.7}$MeV, wherethe quoted uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively. Thestructure is also consistent with being due to two resonances. In addition, thenarrow excited $\varXi^-$ states, $\varXi(1690)^-$ and $\varXi(1820)^-$, areseen for the first time in a $\varXi_b^-$ decay, and their masses and widthsare measured with improved precision. The analysis is performed using $pp$collision data corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 9fb$^{-1}$,collected with the LHCb experiment at centre-of-mass energies of $7$, $8$ and$13$TeV.

Zunica;2021/03/12;http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07349v2;This Letter reports the first measurement of prompt $\chi_{c1}$ and$\chi_{c2}$ charmonium production in nuclear collisions at Large HadronCollider energies. The cross-section ratio $\sigma(\chi_{c2}) /\sigma(\chi_{c1})$ is measured in $p$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 8.16TeV, collected with the LHCb experiment. The $\chi_{c1,2}$ states arereconstructed via their decay to a $\rm{J}/\psi$ meson, subsequently decayinginto a pair of oppositely charged muons, and a photon, which is reconstructedin the calorimeter or via its conversion in the detector material. Thecross-section ratio is consistent with unity in the two considered rapidityregions. Comparison with a corresponding cross-section ratio previouslymeasured by the LHCb collaboration in $pp$ collisions suggests that $\chi_{c1}$and $\chi_{c2}$ states are similarly affected by nuclear effects occurring in$p$Pb collisions.
