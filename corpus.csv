Reddit;How many years of top-level club football do you think Messi has left in him?;movin4call;2023/01/06;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/104ddwr/how_many_years_of_toplevel_club_football_do_you/;No, this is not meant to be negative. Just curious.Messi has won everything possible at club and international level. He can now play with a free spirit so I expect him to play really well with PSG.But Father Time is undefeated. Even Ronaldo ended up moving to Asia at his age.While he is undoubtedly at the back end of his career, he is still brilliant. He no longer runs as much and hardly presses as much also. Even if he loses his ability to score goals, I expect him to stay on top as one of the greatest passers of all time. The man has a brilliant mind to see runs and make pinpoint passes.I am curious how many years Messi has left to play top-level club football in Europe (competing for Champions League). What do you think?

Reddit;Should I keep playing football or look for a new hobby?;PangolinOk3665;2023/01/06;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/104e135/should_i_keep_playing_football_or_look_for_a_new/;"Should I stick with this sport?Hey guys. I've been playing this sport since I was 4 and continued up unto junior year in Highschool (17). From senior year to age 21 I took a 3 year hiatus from the game to focus on college and work. I came back to it in September of 2022 and started playing with a really good team. We don't play official matches, but we train very hard to improve our game. Scrimmages get very intense. We have guys from Africa, Europe, Mexico, and South America playing with us. The games used to be really fun, but I'm really struggling with imposter syndrome to be honest. If you fuck up and lose the ball, they get onto you immediately. Every time I receive the ball I just want to pass it off, or take a shot so I don't have to carry it. The anxiety I experience makes playing the game horrible.When I'm playing with friends or a pick up game, I usually score between 8-10 goals just having fun, but during these training sessions with the team, I only get 2 or 3.Some guys start yelling at me, or saying I need to work harder. I don't mind constructive criticism, it's just when I hear them say don't pass the ball to me, or when they yell at me or say: ""What the fuck are you doing!?""...I just want to say screw it...I'll go train by myself.I don't plan on being a professional, I just want to play to have fun, stay fit and improve my game. It used to be a sport I could use to get away from my worries at work and life, now I go there just to get stressed out. Again, I'm not against tough coaching and criticism or even anxiety, I just can't deal with the  stress anymore.Should I find a new hobby? Or just man up and stick with the team?"

Reddit;[Liverpool] Even with the injuries, Klopp has a lot of options for midfielders. So why does he keep playing the same three?;Strange-Teacher6666;2023/01/05;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/103ypzb/liverpool_even_with_the_injuries_klopp_has_a_lot/;Don’t get me wrong, I know Thiago and Fabinho are extremely skilled. But whatever they are doing is obviously not working. Other teams are able to easily get behind them and attack our four defenders on fast counter attacks.   I guess I’m asking is why does Klopp not change his midfield in any way the last few games. Put in some of the younger players like Carvalho or the three academy kids. Or even put one of our defenders in a sweeper position.   I guess I’m just confused why he isn’t trying to try new things when it is glaringly obvious we have a gaping hole in the center. So in summary can someone explain to me why he doesn’t use a new set up and sticks with the same three?

Reddit;Players who would be more globally know had they’ve been of a different nationality?;Great_Individual673;2023/01/05;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/1045s8z/players_who_would_be_more_globally_know_had/;In Peru, we have several players who are wildly known domestically and perhaps even in the continental level, previously Paolo Guerrero and now Christian Cueva and Gianluca Lapadula. However I imagine the vast majority of soccer fans worldwide don’t know about them (maybe heard of Lapadula back in 2016 when he was in Milan). In the 2018 WC, I felt many fans thought of Peru kinda like Panama as both didn’t have well known players even though Peru is a level up. Kinda feel Peruvians would have had a chance to become better known had Cueva converted his penalty against Denmark in 2018 (might have made Peru end up 4 points while Denmark would have had 3 had all other results  stayed the same.)I also think of how many Moroccan players like Boufal and Ounahi been little known globally before the tournament. Are there other players you feel would have been more well known had they’ve been of a different nationality or had gone further in the World Cup?

Reddit;AUTOGRAPH REQUEST BY EMAIL TO TEAMS;TheScorpion01;2023/01/05;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/10450y3/autograph_request_by_email_to_teams/;Hi. I'd like to ask you kindly if there's a way to ask for some autographed cards to European teams (so I wanna know if there's something similar to what happens with F1 teams, to whom who follow F1 too, maybe you know what I'm talking about). I have some teams that I hugely support since I was very little, but I don't mind getting autographs from footballers playing for other teams, as I am a massive football fan above all and I do admire talents regardless of the jersey they are wearing. I'm from Italy, so maybe it might be easier to ask for them, if there's the possibiliy, innit?
Reddit;Place of South America in World Football!?;Great_Individual673;2023/01/05;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/1044v5q/place_of_south_america_in_world_football/;When I was little, I used to think of South America as joint with Europe as the heavyweights of  the sport. However as I grew older, was disappointed in seeing that UEFA is seen as up and away the most dominant region and CONMEBOL is arguably more on the level of other regions like AFC, CAF and CONCACAF. While Argentina won the most recent WC, the Argentine league is arguably becoming less and less relevant and many of its top players are now going to MLS and not one of the top 5 European leagues. The Brazilian league is the most financially strong but even it can’t compete with MLS or now the Saudi Pro League for players heavy in marketing. In the World economy too, Latin America is becoming seen as irrelevant due to having a smaller population and less economic growth compared to Asia and Africa. Football is something where they generally stood out but not as much as in past decades. I also feel Brazil (in 2000s)and Argentina (in 2020s) were able to win the World Cup in eras of where they dominated regional competition. In the 2010s where Uruguay, Chile and Colombia got more to their level, Argentina and Brazil struggled more with the top European teams.

Reddit;Why is Messi reduced to just stats now while other players that create magic like Ronaldinho, Zidane or Maradona didn't face this issue?;spexyg;2023/01/05;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/103ozch/why_is_messi_reduced_to_just_stats_now_while/;I hate the fact that old players like Ronaldinho, Zidane, Garrincha, Maradona, Cryuff aren't considered legends or even GOATs during the time for their stats specifically but for how they owned in the pitch, but when it comes to Messi now, a lot of people reduce Messi down solely into his stats as if sports is Maths. Ofcourse he is statistically better than everyone but he still has the same magic factor or even better actually than many legends. Certain plays these old legendary magicians like Ronaldinho, Garrincha, Zidane did weren't even on the stats because their play might result in a goal but might not even be an actual stat that is compared right? Also football is a team game afterall anyone's mistake can result in a miss afterall but that doesn't mean the player contributing a pass didn't do his part, he did it perfectly there too. If they check stats for that like goals and assists then being called football legends would make no sense especially comparing to Ronaldo and Messi's stats in Europe.Messi can do all of this together in the same time: He can do what Pirlo, Zidane, Kaka, Iniesta, Modric, Xavi etc do by being an insane playmaker from a deeper role with insane vision. He can dribble and create magic like Maradona, Garrincha and Ronaldinho could. He has more assists than all dedicated attacking free role creators like Ozil, David Silva, De Bruyne and more. And after all of this, he scores goals against and competes with goalscoring legends like Ronaldo, Pele etc. Ronaldo is compared to Messi with stats, which looks good for Ronaldo in the eyes of a casual. But with that logic, like I said, Ronaldinho, Zidane, Iniesta, Cruyff etc would never be legends because stats wise they aren't as good, longetivity wise too! Even Ronaldo and Suarez has more assists than Iniesta because they are in the attacking 3. It's sad that media forgets to look at Messi's magic that is similar to all these legends while comparing him to literally anyone. They just check stats like robots.Also what if someone like Haaland actually get better stats by banging goals and people from the next generation thinks he's better just because Messi was unfairly reduced to just stats? People are even comparing Messi to Mbappe based on stats now even if 9/13 goals Mbappe scored were Messi assists this season and no one would remember it in the future incase Mbappe gets better stats, which I don't think will happen because Messi at 24 scored 91 goals and Mbappe even if he is leading now will have lesser goals than Messi having played more matches by next December. But again these are just stats, based on how I've seen them play, they don't seem as magical.A robot would call Ronaldo's individual stats comparable to Messi, but has humans, we have the brain and logic to understand so much more than the final output, Messi's gamesense, decisions, how he creates a chance out 0% chance (like the pass against Netherlands and the goals where he dribble 5-6 players) should be more thought of. But the insane part is Ronaldo as of now has 142 games more than Messi and still only has SIXTEEN GOALS MORE. So maybe Ronaldo will score so much in Saudi and keep the goals record but as of now even a robot would say Messi's stats are better even if they reduce it to just stats which is also so crazy to me?So I hope when someone praises Messi later on, they put some weight on the fact that Messi isn't just stats, isn't just assists or goals but instead equally it should be mentioned that he has the same magic factor the legends who didn't have impressive stats on paper had. Even if Messi is better than everyone as of now purely on stats, that shouldn't hover over how good he is as a magician like Maradona and Ronaldinho is.
Reddit;Lautaro 22 is basically Higuain 14;themanfromthere12;2023/01/05;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/103zg2t/lautaro_22_is_basically_higuain_14/;Lautaro had a good presence on the field, he could fight for the ball and keep possession. But in terms of scoring opportunities conversation, he reminded me of Higuain from 2014.  After failing to perform in the opening match against SA he was benched. Against Australia he had some abysmal misses. In the final after coming on in the extra time, he managed to squander another two great opportunities. He was set up with a great shooting chance inside the box, but took too much time and allowed a French defender to block his shot. And in the dying minutes of extra time he was set up with a perfect soft cross, and somehow managed to head it completely wide.Edit: and forgot to mention, even when they scored the third goal Lautaro made a wrong decision and was lucky that it ended up in the net. After receiving the ball in the box, instead of passing to Messi who was wide open, he chose to take a shot from a very hard angle, a shot that Lloris managed to stop, and it was only a pure luck that the ball fell to Messi who managed to score at the rebound.
Reddit;How good exactly is Mbappe to you in terms of technique ONLY?;KazamaShintaro7;2023/01/05;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/103y4lw/how_good_exactly_is_mbappe_to_you_in_terms_of/;Mbappe is a very polarising player in this area. By some he is compared to R9 who is one of the most technically gifted players ever. By others he is called a pace merchant who can just run fast.Now in my estimation he’s not really on R9’s level in technique BUT definitely not a pace merchant. I’ve seen him do things that are pretty R9-esque with the ball that don’t involve his speed. I recall his games vs Madrid last year his last minute goal in the first leg and this R9-esque dummy to Courtois to score a goal that was disallowed and ofc the little dribbling run in the final play of the game vs Argentina in extra time.I’ve seen him compared to guys like Bale but I think Mbappe is a lot better in creating something out of nothing when pace is out the window. (Not calling Bale a pace merchant tho ofc). He can be clumsy at times but have a pretty elegant first touch on other occasions.

Through this they can review certain decisions if they feel the on field ref got it wrong. For Penalties, Red Cards ( maybe Yellow cards if second yellow for a player) only ofcourse to reduce time wastage. No need for the stupid If they get it wrong they lose the review, but it is retained if they get it right. Would help a lot with managers and players aggrievement. Innit? Like the Gabriel shirt pull yesterday. And the replays have to be shown to the whole stadium real time.

Reddit;Could Erling Haaland win the Ballon D'or ahead of favourite Messi if he wins the ucl, premier league, FA Cup and EFL cup?;Highiqcells2;2023/01/04;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/102obmv/could_erling_haaland_win_the_ballon_dor_ahead_of/;"Before the World Cup, Erling Haaland has been one of the most talked about players since his move to premier league champions Man city. He is on track to breaking Salah's record of 32 goals in a season and also holds a good spot in UCl with City and is in a good spot in the UCL golden boot with currently Kylian Mbappe being on top. Talking about Mbappe, I do not think Kylian Mbappe could win the ballon Dor due to the fact he shares the same team (PSG) and spotlight with Lionel Messi and with thr world cup golden ball,World cup and 2nd in ranking in golden boot race Messi is in the lead of Mbappe by a big margin in terms of winning the Ballon Dor if only world Cup were included in Ballon Dor rankings. The only possible loophole Mbappe could take to have a chance is probably if Messi gets an injury or outshines him by a great margin in UCL football. If not Mbappe is just helping Messi get his 8th Ballon dor with every goal that he scores.Back to Erling Haaland though. Man City are one of the favourites alongside PSG and Bayern Munich and Haaland is shining in that team and Man city are regarded as the ""best"" team in the world right now. If all adds up he could win the UCL probaly also picking up the golden boot in the process. The premier League however may be tougher for Man city. Arsenal are strong favourites after going 8 points clear of City playing 1 game more. However City are known for making comebacks in the last 10 years, so if Pep Guardiola can sort out the team for the league he could see himself win the league with the golden boot especially with the squa depth that team has compared to other title challengers. FA and EFL cup are also competitions City are favourites in. And Haaland could easily pick them up if he plays in those competitions. Also with City squad depth they will probably dominate in FA and EFL cup with a B team. With that in mind Haaland has a high chance of winning every major trophy in english football this season with City in turn giving his a very high chance of winning the ballon dor. However this is a what if scenario, many things could go wrong or other team and players way and we still have a long season until 2023 ballon dor is announced around October, so we just got to witness and watch the beatiful game.But if lets say this did happen, who do you think would be the winner of ballon dor? Messi? Haaland? or Mbappe? or someone else?"

I only know the a few players like Messi, Ronaldo, and Neymar. I now watch football on my spare time and slowly liking the sport. I am now beginning to slowly understand the rules and terminologies by through watching  a lot of games of popular teams like Real Madrid and Barcelona.

Reddit;If Ronaldo wins a AFC CL and Messi stays on 4 UCL, would CR7 get back into the GOAT conversation?;None;2023/01/05;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/103qyi7/if_ronaldo_wins_a_afc_cl_and_messi_stays_on_4_ucl/;So technically speaking Messi does have 4 ucl medals however he only played and been instrumental in 3 of those wins (rode on Ronaldinho and Etoo coat tails in 06 with addition to being injured). While on the other hand CR7 has been to 6 finals with 5 medals and has been instrumental in all 6 and played a big role in all finals played, 6 to Messi's 3. He also holds the most goals in knockouts, all time, finals, top scorer and especially the BIG 3 PEAT in the UCL. Surely this should be counted as something towards the finale of the GOAT discussion. UCL is the most premier competitive tournament in the world club football, reaching 6 finals being the main man compared to 3 is a big difference. A 3 peat beats 2 trebles in 7 seasons imo also. You cannot choose which country you are born in and Argentina historically has a rich trophy cabinet so to win a copy America isn't as big as a Euros win (1st International trophy ever for Portugal) and Argentina no doubt holds far more quality players in each generation Messi has played in, Riqueleme, Aguero, Higuain, Tevez, Di Maria, Alvarez, Mascherano, Ayala, Heinze, Cambiasso, Crespo, Milito (Both), Veron, Samuel, Zabaleta, Maxi Rodriguez etcWhile Ronaldo has had Quaresma, Pepe, Figo, Pauleta, Nani, Moutinho, Coentrao, Simao, Deco, Leao, Felix, Fernandes, Dias, Cancelo, Bernardo Silva - last 7 players came from the last World Cup only! Quality and history wise, Messi should have been able to win a copa while reaching at least the semi finals was always expected of the Argentines. What Ronaldo essentially did was win with a team that was not expected to like Denmark or Greece or Chile which makes it much more of a accomplishment. World Cup shouldn't define the GOAT debate.

Why would you do that?Edit: Why the fuck I'm being downvoted ffs? Do people know what a debate is? Fuck.

However could you argue Pele prior to his passing was self absorbed and inflated his own success at the expense of others? There seems to be more than meets the eye with his 3x world cup successes, which at face value is an outstanding feat not soon to be replicated, but is his contribution overblown? Names like Garrincha, Didi, Jarzinho and a plethora of others in a highly talented Brazilian team contributed just as much if not more at a time when Brazil dominated world football.I feel his media presence over the years has promoted his legacy as an undisputed 'legend'  and played on our nostalgia. His career never had the controversy of Maradona and Garrincha and as a result capitalised on this contrast to raise his own legacy. Albeit never saw him play but I've recently taken an interest in him and haven't found a discussion about this on this sub. Curious to hear your thoughts.

Reddit;What do you think about a revolutionary approach to managing a football club? Read below!;SunFull9303;2023/01/03;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/102942e/what_do_you_think_about_a_revolutionary_approach/;"Hello, guys. I am a manager with ten years of experience managing a professional football team (in the Italian 3rd division). After my most recent experience, a distinct idea has stuck in my head, and I would want to hear your thoughts on it.In these ten years, I've come to the realization—and it's not a big realization—that practically any football company's toughest task isn't to win games, it's to **SURVIVE**. This assertion is more accurate the lower the level, but if you think about it, even the biggest football team has significant financial problems. This is due to the fact that football frequently has costs that are larger than profits, and this anti-economic circumstance is practically unique in the market.However, it should be remembered that football is a ""normal"" company just like the film industry, and **that its product, ENTERTAINMENT,** must be promoted and sold to its maximum potential, to make profits.The same methods are used by all football teams nowadays to generate revenue: player trading, sponsorships, merchandising, and that's about it. However, in my opinion, this is insufficient to produce a steady and sufficient amount of money.  So, I was thinking recently that it's necessary to develop a cutting-edge strategy to turn a club into a successful business, and that in order to do so, we must ""**invent the wheel**,"" in the sense of finding a **cutting-edge approach** to ""carry"" the revenue (The same approach that the ancient people took when they discovered that carrying things was too tiring).There are billions of soccer enthusiasts worldwide, and millions of FIFA, Football Manager players pay millions to simulate running THEIR CLUB.I believe there would be a huge market for a club (a new club), which allows his fans (or members, partners, etc.) to **truly feel like a manager**, adopting a **really inclusive marketing strategy**, intended to maximize the selling of the real product of football, which is, as I previously stated: ENTERTAINMENT.This club would market football as entertainment (and not as a religion), as well as enjoyment, local experiences, and so on.The goal would be to give you the impression that you are a manager, scout, or even a coach (do you know about the ""IKEA EFFECT""?).What are your thoughts on this vision?"

No need to keep making fun of where his carreer went to. He'll always stays one of the greatest players in our generation.

He has 218 goals and 108 assists, meaning he has 326 G+A in 299 games. This means he contributes either a goal or assist every 69 minutes (if you round up from 69.69). He has a world cup to his name and has 5 league trophies and 8 domestic cups to his name.

Reddit;My thoughts on Liverpools attack this season;itisme1256;2023/01/03;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/101rx2h/my_thoughts_on_liverpools_attack_this_season/; As we all know far too well, it hasn't been the greatest season for us so far. But even more worryingly, it doesn't seem like this team has the key elements needed to re-start our season and drive us into top 4 contention. Throughout the season all 3 key aspects of attack, midfield and defence have been at best inconsistent and at worst woeful. A lot has been said about our need for new signings and I fully agree that at least 2 new midfielders are needed in the next couple of transfer windows, however for now (as it doesn't look likely that there will be a new signing this January) we need to work with what we have.Attack: A lot has been said about our lack of potency this season, and particularly about Nunez and his inconsistent finishing. But for me more worrying is the lack of cohesion that can be seen in our front 3. One of the greatest things about Firmino, Salah and Mane (plus Jota and Diaz later on) was their suitability to any attacking role - Mane being a great example who often transitioned between all three positions within a game. And I just don't see that with this current attack. Salah has been relegated to a much wider, conventional winger role (although when he has got through the middle he has been devastating, such as against Rangers), Firmino isn't the player he used to be and Nunez lacks the basic technical ability to be a true successor to Mane - and this use of him as a focal point means that the role of Salah, Diaz and Firmino is massively diminished. Although the signing of Gakpo is a step in the right direction, and Klopp looks to be building a fantastic, young and talented attack for the future, right now there isn't the threat there has been over the past 5 years - we simply don't look like scoring 2 or even 3 times a game without mistakes from the opposing team (or in the case of Leicester, 2 own goals).

The huge differences in key things like training to begin with, and furthermore in how much players are worth, or how much they earn is mad, let alone the rules and VAR. Or even some basic things: the amount of images and videos we have to watch the older players is quite few compared to that of nowadays. Even old people might do not have that clear images in their mind from those years.It's like asking 'was Hippocrates a better doctor than René Favaloro?' The change medicine had undergone is brutal for that question to be resolved and though of course the change in football isn't that big, it has to be taken into account.

Reddit;Mbappé sayings about South American football being underdeveloped compared with the European football triggered several people... but is it true?;idontdomath8;2022/12/31;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zzmdvb/mbappé_sayings_about_south_american_football/;"The date was May 25th 2022. Mbappé was giving [an interview to TNT Sports Brazil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NCCrRMca_0) and he said a phrase that touched many, **many** people in South America:**Original (in French):**>""L'avantage qu'on a nous les Européens, c'est qu’on joue toujours entre nous, et on a des matchs de haut niveau, comme par exemple la Ligue des Nations. Quand on arrive à la Coupe du Monde, on est prêts. Là où le Brésil et l'Argentine n'ont pas ce niveau-là en Amérique du Sud. Le football n'est pas aussi avancé qu'en Europe. C'est pour ça que lors des dernières Coupes du monde, ce sont toujours les Européens qui ont gagné.""**Translation (in English):**>""The advantage we Europeans have is that we always play between us, in high level matches like the Nations League. When we arrive to the World Cup, we are ready. Brazil and Argentina don't have that level in South America. The football is not as advanced as here in Europe. That's why the last World Champions are always Europeans.""Lautaro Martínez, Richarlison, Fabinho and multiple other South American players replied to his sayings by pointing that the football level in the Conmebol is pretty high and the extra difficulties (like weather, altitude) made the matches pretty intense. But if we check the facts... **is it true what Mbappé said?**I'll do my best to don't be biased in this analysis (since I'm Argentinian) so I'll focus purely in results and stats, what aren't subjectives at all. I'll check four different but related topics, the **WC best performances**, **WC worst performances, WC mean performances** and **head to head results**, for the last 4 World Cups (I think there's no point to check results for +15 years ago if the debate is about nowadays performance).# World Cup best performances:The first point to check is the best teams of every one of these 4 World Cups, so we'll take a look to the teams that completed the 7 games in each tournament, the semi-finalists.* South Africa 2010: Uruguay, Netherlands, Germany, Spain* Brazil 2014: Brazil, Germany, Argentina, Netherlands* Russia 2018: France, Belgium, Croatia, England* Qatar 2022: Argentina, Croatia, France, Morocco.If we sum up the results for each confederation, we have 11 UEFA teams, 4 Conmebol teams and 1 CAF team, clear advantage for Europe. But we must take into account how many slots each confederation has, because there are different amounts of qualified teams from each continent. For the last 4 World Cups, the slots assigned were the same in each tournament:* AFC: 4.5 teams (\~14% out of 32).* CAF: 5 teams (\~16% out of 32).* Concacaf: 3.5 teams (\~11% out of 32).* Conmebol: 4.5 teams (\~14% out of 32).* OFC: 0.5 teams (\~2% out of 32).* UEFA: 13 teams (\~41% out of 32).So, considering the percentage of participants from each confederation, in 4 World Cups would be expected to have 6.5 semi-finalists from UEFA and 2.2 semi-finalists from Conmebol. Clearly, because of the low level from CAF, AFC, Concacaf and OFC, both UEFA and Conmebol are overperforming, almost by doubling the expected semi-finalists in 4 tournaments.# World Cup worst performances:The only way to see the worst performances in the tournaments is using the **final standings table** (although I'm not a big fan of it, I believe that it doesn't really represent the performances of the teams). Because of having much more teams qualified, it's expected that there will be UEFA teams in lower positions compared to Conmebol teams, but how many European teams were *worst* than the worst South American team in every World Cup?**South Africa 2010:*** Worst team from Conmebol: Chile (10th)* UEFA teams lower than 10th: 10 teams (77%) - Portugal (11th), England (13th), Slovakia (16th), Slovenia (18th), Switzerland (19th), Serbia (23rd), Denmark (24th), Greece (25th), Italy (26th), France (29th).**Brazil 2014:*** Worst team from Conmebol: Ecuador (17th)* UEFA teams lower than 17th: 7 teams (54%) - Portugal (18th), Croatia (19th), Bosnia (20th), Italy (22nd), Spain (23rd), Russia (24th), England (26th).**Russia 2018:*** Worst team from Conmebol: Peru (20th)* UEFA teams lower than 20th: 4 teams (31%) - Germany (22nd), Serbia (23rd), Poland (25th), Iceland (28th).**Qatar 2022:*** Worst team from Conmebol: Uruguay (20th)* UEFA teams lower than 20th: 4 teams (31%) - Belgium (23rd), Denmark (28th), Serbia (29th), Wales (30th).We can get from this information that there are always several European teams in the bottom of the final standings, and even the worst South American teams tend to be at least at mid of the table.# World Cup mean performances:Again, using the same **final standings table**, we can check easily which is the mean position for every confederation in every World Cup, just by grabbing every team for each continent together and then getting the mean position. The results are the following:**South Africa 2010:*** AFC: 4 teams, average position: 20th.* CAF: 5 teams, average position: 22nd.* Concacaf: 3 teams, average position: 19th.* Conmebol: 5 teams, average position: 7th.* OFC: 1 team, average position: 22nd.* UEFA: 13 teams, average position: 16th.**Brazil 2014:*** AFC: 4 teams, average position: 29th.* CAF: 5 teams, average position: 22nd.* Concacaf: 3 teams, average position: 16th.* Conmebol: 5 teams, average position: 8th.* OFC: no teams.* UEFA: 13 teams, average position: 15th.**Russia 2018:*** AFC: 4 teams, average position: 21st.* CAF: 5 teams, average position: 24nd.* Concacaf: 3 teams, average position: 24th.* Conmebol: 5 teams, average position: 11th.* OFC: no teams.* UEFA: 13 teams, average position: 12th.**Qatar 2022:*** AFC: 4 teams, average position: 20th.* CAF: 5 teams, average position: 16nd.* Concacaf: 3 teams, average position: 24th.* Conmebol: 4 teams, average position: 12th.* OFC: no teams.* UEFA: 13 teams, average position: 15th.The average position of every confederation help us see how good they perform in every World Cup in general, where we can see that despite the fact that 3 out of the last 4 champions are European, there are several teams with a level so low that makes the mean UEFA position be lower than the mean Conmebol position in every World Cup (even in Russia where the 4 semi-finalists where European).# Head to headsLast but not least (indeed, I think this is the most important topic) we should see every match where a South American team faced an European one. If we check the records for each of the last 4 World Cups, we could see the following results:* South Africa 2010: 3-3-6* Brazil 2014: 8-2-5* Russia 2018: 4-4-5* Qatar 2022: 4-4-1* **Total: 19-13-17**So we can see that in general the Conmebol teams perform slightly better against UEFA teams. Many people tend to say that Argentina and Brazil carry the full confederation, so let's remove both from this head-to-heads and check again the records. We end up with:* South Africa 2010: 2-2-4* Brazil 2014: 4-1-2* Russia 2018: 3-1-3* Qatar 2022: 0-1-1* **Total: 9-5-10**The result is that the record is practically even again, in this scenario with the Europeans ahead just by one match. But doing this last research makes me think that it's unfair removing the best performing teams from South America but considering every team from Europe. We could also say that the big UEFA teams from the last 4 World Cups carried the whole confederation, like Germany, France and the Netherlands. So if we remove those 3 teams too we get these final record:* South Africa 2010: 2-1-2* Brazil 2014: 4-0-1* Russia 2018: 3-1-1* Qatar 2022: 0-0-1* **Total: 9-2-5**In this scenario we can see a more clear difference in favor of South American teams, who have won almost twice as the European teams. So we can conclude that the mid-level teams in Conmebol have an advantage over the mid-level teams in UEFA.# Final thoughtsAfter doing all this research my personal conclusion is that Mbappé sayings weren't just out of the line, but they were also incorrect. It is true that 4 out of the last 5 World Cup champions were European, but it's also true that UEFA has almost 3 times the slots that Conmebol has, and when they face each other there is almost no difference (I could even say that the South American teams perform better). It is also true that there were fantastic European teams in the last World Cups, and maybe the reason why most of the champions came from UEFA was because the big Conmebol teams (Argentina and Brazil) couldn't get solid teams in the last tournaments, and since there are much less South American teams, most of the continent hopes resides in just a pair of teams (despite the fact that teams like Uruguay, Paraguay and Colombia made great appearances). And finally, there are many, **many** European teams that have a pretty lame level, who usually finish in the last standings of each World Cup, and they are also part of Europe, and when talking about UEFA we must also consider them, not just the big teams that we all know about.What are your opinions on this subject? I'll also try to post this in r/soccer and r/worldcup, just in case that it's not approved by some of the mods."
Reddit;Am I the only one who thinks the Mbappè/Real Madrid was a lot more complicated than people make it out to be.;KazamaShintaro7;2022/12/31;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zzgndp/am_i_the_only_one_who_thinks_the_mbappèreal/;From what i’ve seen a lot of people think that he turned down Madrid purely for the money. But based Mbappé’s history prior to that transfer suggested he was a person who stuck to his morals and to a degree he still does.We’re talking about a guy who refused to be in commercials for the French team because of what they promoted. I.e Fast Food, Gambling etc. He also hid the Heineken logo from his man of the match trophies. Real Madrid apparently didn’t allow him as much control over his image rights.The biggest think I want to talk about though is the politics involved… he received calls from people like Nicolas Sarkozy (Former French President) and Macron (Current President) urging him to stay. He is the pride and joy of France and probably their most talented player since Zidane. I can only imagine the pressure that he had not only from his nation but from country leaders themselves. It’s a lot for a guy who was only 23 at the time. I think the money could have been part of it but it’s an oversimplification at the same time.
Reddit;Who right now is the best big game performer in the world???;KazamaShintaro7;2022/12/31;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zzkir3/who_right_now_is_the_best_big_game_performer_in/;Benzema comes to mind as he put together possibly the greatest individual UCL run ever. Messi was just huge in this WC. The Mexico game changed everything for Argentina.Mbappè between his performances vs Real Madrid in 2022 (even if he lost) and the composure to hit those two penalties in arguably the most high pressure situations i’ve seen for a footballer was just amazing and that volley was simply *chefs kiss* can’t think of any 23 year old player who could perform do THAT under such circumstances.Modric I would also say truly has ice in his veins.

I highly doubt that if he chose to stay in Europe that he would achieve anything significant, also I don't think he would be a starter at a top club and I don't think he would settle for that.  Also how would his move damage in anyway his legacy? 5 Ballon Dors, 5 CLs, 4 golden shoes, Euro Cup, and countless other trophies and records. LOL what is there left for him to prove at age 38?And also just so you know, Pele decided to move to MLS at 35 yo, and as you see his legacy is fine.Edit: I understand that his European career didn't end as nicely as he would want to. Since he left Madrid he was playing mostly for himself without committing to anyone, and once it got rocky both in Juve and MU he ran to the door. But that's CR7 for you, always has been.

Reddit;European football fans have the shortest memories of all sports fans.;cemma2035;2022/12/31;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zzisjt/european_football_fans_have_the_shortest_memories/;It absolutely pains me to have witnessed how you all treated Ronaldo this last year. Man had 1 subpar season and you totally disregard the last 2 decades of pure quality that he gave the sport.You may have forgotten but here in Africa (and I'm sure Asia and Middle East as well), we still remember that he is one of the greatest players to every kick a football. You're so spoiled having these greats in your backyard that you so easily disregard them. And the audacity to feel betrayed when he decides to follow the money instead of jumping through hoops to please you as he's met with nothing but disrespect.I'm happy for Saudi Arabian fans who get to witness first hand the final days of a wonderful career and I'm happy for Ronaldo who can once again play in front of cheering fans and media that actually want to see him succeed.Can't wait to see who you'll betray next? If you can even turn your backs on a 5 time Ballon d'Or winner, is anyone safe?
Reddit;Ronaldo move to Saudi Arabia is the medias fault.;Marktheshark455;2022/12/31;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zzsrd7/ronaldo_move_to_saudi_arabia_is_the_medias_fault/;This might be a little rant, but just bare with me. Why are people so shocked that Ronaldo took the Cash bag and went Saudi Arabia. Has anyone been paying attention to how the media has attacked this man this past year? Do I agree with everything Ronaldo has done these past couple months, no. But we are talking about one of , if not the greatest players to ever live, and the respect shown to this man has been a complete joke. Does anyone here actually believe that a player who scored a hattrick earlier this year against spurs is finished. His son died, anyone who experienced that before knows it’s not easy to recover from. The club he gave his everything for didn’t believe him when his own daughter was sick. The media started this narrative that he was finished and a problem for Manchester United when he was banging hattricks. Top scorer on the team, and they took advantage of it when he lost his son. I don’t think Ronaldo wanted to go Saudi Arabia, but believe me if he went Chelsea or Bayern, the media will continue attacking him saying he shouldn’t start. Ronaldo probably just wanted peace and decided to give everyone the middle finger and dip , I don’t blame him. We don’t deserve him. I don’t care if you’re a Messi fan , anyone who doesn’t see the brilliance of this man and what he gave to the sport , should stop watching soccer. Ronaldo is the most hated athlete because he’s the most successful and I have so much respect for him how he was able to deal with media ,fifa all these years against him. Michael Jordan said if he played today he wouldn’t survive playing because of the media for his mental health. Imagine Ronaldo.

In watching [this](https://twitter.com/tancredipalmeri/status/1608615839183556608?t=14WgDTBPMA_0cQmm8XyDZw&s=08), i see: Zidane meets Ronaldinho, meets Messi, without exaggeration. Fitness levels and sports medicine aside, footy is the *only* major sport that i can think of that you could take a **boss** from several decades ago, throw him into the arena, and they'd still dominate against modern professionals. There's something to be said about that, i think.Respect to this cat for that.   Fucking Legend. RIP.

Now if you want to give Messi the next Ballon D'or for his WC triumph, well then it will be a little bit weird to give an award for the best player in 2023 for achievements made in 2022. When the 2023 voting would take place, the memory of WC will be already a bit faded. So this situation is a bit strange. Nobody thinks about Benzema right now, and yet he is the best player in 2022 according to the Ballon D'or. So Messi performance in the WC is too late for BD22 and too early for BD23, what a shame.

I just try to put neutral opinions. no emotional thinking which most football fans suffer from. &#x200B;1-Zidane: heavily inconsistent. great player and balondor worthy no doubt. but people dont realize how inconsistent he was. if any one wanna see the best version fo him watch euro 2000. 2-Ibrahimo: he is heavily overrated. yes he score goals but most of them are taps ins and due to his postioning and getting feeded from midfield. there are other skills outside scoring such as intelligent movement, passing, pressing, creativity and he was lacking it all esp the movement. he is a motherfucker lazy. I know my insult may trigger his fans but idc. I dont idiolize.3-cristiano ronaldo: He is exceptional only at three things: postional awareness, explosivity and shooting. other things he is above medicore regard it but not exceptional4-Ronaldinho: listen i dont know any more overrated than him. his dribblings were slowing the game. his tactics was slowing the game. he is just a showboat. and I watched many of his matches. this opinion may trigger some but I swear by god its my truth.5-R9: nah im kiddingand thats is. please no insults. be civil. it is not worthy to have anger regarding millionares who dont know even our existance."

Reddit;Why is nobody talking about the team Messi won the World Cup with?;NoahCGC;2022/12/30;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zyyjr6/why_is_nobody_talking_about_the_team_messi_won/;One of Messi's biggest criticisms throughout his career is how he's always played in the best teams with the best players.I'm sure we've all heard how he can't win without Xavi and Iniesta, and with Argentina how he's had world class forwards in Aguero, Di Maria, Tevez etc. Therefore, I am surprised as to why nobody has mentioned the fact that Messi won the World Cup with a side that contained literally nobody compared to the level of players he's been criticized for having the luxury of playing with his entire career.Personnel wise, this was Argentina's worst squad in a very long time, not performance wise obviously, a majority of them played at the top of their game which is largely to do with Messi being able to elevate the players around him to a new level, however if we go through the core players 1 by 1, we'll begin to see the lack of world beaters there are.Emi Martinez - Bench warmer at Arsenal for a decade and currently plays for Aston Villa. Arguably their 2nd best player of the tournament.  Acuna/Tagliafico/Molina/Montiel - Ask any average football fan, they would know next to nothing about any of Argentina's full-backs.  Otamendi - Became known for being one of the most error prone defenders in the world.  Romero - Nobody knew him before joining Spurs. Even now people would struggle to say much about him.  Enzo - Plays for Benfica. Unless you have an eye for young talent, absolutely nobody knew who he was before this World Cup, arguably their 2nd best player of the tournament.  De Paul - Was playing for Udinese just last year. Is one of the better known players mainly because he's known for basically being Messi's bodyguard.  Mac Allister - Literally plays for Brighton.  Lautaro Martinez - Had a worse World Cup than Higuain 2014. At least Higuain scored the winner in the quarters, Lautaro missed at least 5 sitters throughout the campaign.  Alvarez - Doesn't even start for his club. Perfect example of a player getting elevated to a world class level during the tournament largely courtesy of Messi.  Di Maria - 2nd best player in the side based on ability and he recently got binned off to Juventus at 34 years old.It is tough to emphasize this point without discrediting the fantastic contribitions made by all the players, but where are the Xavi's, Iniesta's, Neymar's, and Suarez's in this list? Messi won the World Cup with a squad that most people wouldn't really bat an eye about. Something that should really be given more praise and attention.
Reddit;Why the MLS has to change if they want to be a top league with a top US national team.;salfordsoldier00;2022/12/28;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zxhryl/why_the_mls_has_to_change_if_they_want_to_be_a/;The thing about the MLS is its not competitive enough. Almost no self respecting footballer will go to the MLS unless it’s for one last payday at the end of their career. It has potential, but things have to change ESPECIALLY the way you don’t have relegation and promotion. It’s been a major part of the sport since the 1800s which makes it exciting to watch. Nobody wants to watch bottom table MLS teams towards the end of the season, because what’s the point. The players aren’t even trying to win because they have nothing to lose or gain, they already can’t win the league but they know they’re not going down so they just pass the ball around slowly for 90 minutes. Honestly I would hate to play the same teams, every season , year in year out, it’d be so boring. Also the fact that to win the MLS you have to win the playoffs. There is no other league that does this. What’s the point in finishing first in the league, if you still might not win it? It’s absolutely ridiculous. Also, there is no incentive for teams 2-7th place to want to finish higher, either way they will be in the playoffs and have a chance at winning the MLS. It makes games much less competitive. They should merge the Eastern/Western conferences into a single league with normal rules for winners, no playoffs. I know playoffs are “just how you do sports” in the US but if you want your teams and national team to be competitive internationally , then it’s what you have to do. Another thing is the way you “draft” players from college (university) teams, rather than utilising your underfunded and hardly used youth systems. It’s a very strange concept to us, because the rest of the world do not find our athletes this way. Also, it might make it more difficult for the USMNT to develop good players, because the only ones who really get a chance to play professionally are the ones who went to college. Almost every English footballer didn’t go to university, a lot barely even went to school, because they were playing football instead. It just feels like the MLS are using football as a money making revenue machine, rather than as a sport. Which makes sense of their refusal to allow relegation and promotion like every other league. Why do you think Beckham started an MLS team and not any other league? It’s not because he thinks it’s an exciting league, he’s after money. Not just because he was offered it when he signed for Galaxy, but because he knows it’s a safe business investment. He can’t lose, which is good business but it takes all the fun out of football. The MLS will never be popular outside the US, Canada and Mexico until they realise that.

But what I want to know is if clubs need to be able to fund the add ons when signing a player? For example, let’s say a player costs a club £40 Million and £15 million in add ons and the the club only had available £40 million, would they still be able to complete the deal even though they don’t have the add on funds available at the time (even though it won’t be given unless player reaches targets set) , or does it just go off the main fee of £40 million. Idk if that makes sense hopefully it does.

Reddit;Who had the better World Cup campaign?

Goal contributions, dribbling ability, passing quality, clutch match winning moments, leadership etc. I grew up with Messi and as such have an inherent bias towards him, and these are some of the reasons I think he had a better campaign. (I recognize the bias though and would like to know your opinion too)-Was directly involved in the opening goal in 6 out of 7 matches. -Won 5 MOTM awards. Technically 6, but gave away the one against Poland to Mac Allister because he thought he deserved it.-Saved Argentina with his amazing goal against Mexico and provided two of the most beautiful assists in the tournament against Netherlands and Croatia. -Had an untouchable second half vs Australia and was unreal against Netherlands. Prime 2012 Messi vibes when he, even while constantly surrounded by 3 orange players, absolutely toyed with them and only lost the ball once (!!) during the entire game.-Although not *directly* involved, he was at least involved in the immediate buildup of *all* 8 goals scored in the QF, SF and final. -Put Argentina ahead of France twice in the final.-Confidently scored both shootout penalties, against Netherlands and France, to set the mood for the rest of the team. His leadership off the field was amazing too. Have you ever seen THAT many players in a team say they would 'die' for their captain on the field?I absolutely recognize the greatness of Maradona's 1986 campaign though. In terms of legend and mythology, Messi will likely never surpass what El Diego did. But only looking at the actual performances, was he still better (or more inportant) than Messi?

We also saw what having that freakish quickness did to guys like Hazard, Bale, Owen and Kaka.Now I will say this Mbappe is an era where medicine is far far more advanced and he’s not very injury prone overall… and I will also adda he seems a lot lighter than those other guys I mentioned. He naturally has a scrawny build which could reduce the stress on his knees but… I wonder if he is aware himself.

Reddit;The World Cup makes players from every league relevant;Dresdenlive;2022/12/26;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zvv93q/the_world_cup_makes_players_from_every_league/;One thing I loved about watching the World Cup is that it makes players from any league in the world relevant. While the best *teams* in the world play in the Top 5 European leagues, international football shows that players from all over the world can compete with them, and even win when the stakes are so much higher. For example: Benfica players were completely negating Lewandowski (who, in club football, usually dominates because plays on teams that are much richer than his opponents’ clubs). Other (of many) examples: • J-League players (or ones who just recently left Japan) were outplaying La Liga stars, and even stars from the Premier League.• It was surreal seeing Kye Rowles (from Heart of Midlothian in Scotland) play Lio Messi head on in a massive World Cup knockout match, and do it well!• I loved seeing players like Zimmerman (from the MLS) lead USA’s defensive line. I just love how international football makes every league on earth relevant by levelling the playing field in a way that just isn’t possible in a $$$ based “rich eat poor” club system.

Is the debate over? IMO it can reopen if Portugal wins the 2026 worldcup.

Reddit;The REQUIREMENT to win the World Cup in order to be the GOAT is elitist gatekeeping;dangerousman8;2022/12/26;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zvlddf/the_requirement_to_win_the_world_cup_in_order_to/;"Now that Messi has finally won the WC everyone has become more comfortable to title him as the GOAT.But in fact I don't think that the WC changes much about how good he was/is. Most Golden balls, most golden booths, spain's all time goal/assist scorer and most likely the all time champions league scorer/assister given he plays for 2 more years.But there was always the low IQ argument ""bUt mUh nO wOrLd cUp"" argument. Basically if you are not born, or gain pasport of 8 out of 195 countries, you CAN NEVER become the GOAT.No matter how good you are. Also only 80 countries have played in the WC. So if you are born in one of the 115 other,  you will not even get to play in the WC.Case and point Earing Haaland. He can break all the records. Score 2000 goals. Win 10 champions leagues. Win the golden boot 15 times. But because he is norwegian by blood and heart and decided to represent them, instead of his birth country of England, he can never become the GOAT, cuz ""mUh nO wOrLd cUp"".On the other hand winning a WC gives you a 1000% boost.   Look at the brazilian Ronaldo, who in 15 years playing in europe never won champions league, had only 2 domestic titles and won the golden shoe once. But because he was great at the 2002 WC people put him on the same level with players who have been the best at their clubs and in the world, for decades.Or Pele and Maradona for that matter. Nobody would be putting them in the conversation if they havent won the WC. That why a player who was better than both of them Johan Cruyff never gets into the GOAT conversation. BUT if Argentina hadn't bought the 1978 WC everybody would be like Cruyff  da goat, 10 domestic titles, 3 champions leagues in a row, 3 ballon d'or winner, FIFA World Cup Golden Ball and mUh  1978 wOrLd cUp wiNnEr."

We don't know who will qualify or what the nations will look like in 3 1/2 years from now but for me, as it stands, I see France, Spain, Morocco, and the U.S. reaching the semis. And ending with a France v Spain final. France continuously looks so good, will have an even better Mbappe, and will be a huge achievement to reach the final back-to-back-to-back at the world cup. Spain still seems like a team in transition right now, but will be a strong force by then with this new up-and-coming generation they are producing, and who knows, maybe even be led by Pep by then? Morocco surprised the world this world cup and I see them repeating this feat since their group is relatively youngish and their players will improve more by then. Finally, this might be my patriotism talking but I feel the U.S. will finally show the world how good its golden generation is as most, if not all, will be in their prime and will be playing a lot of games at home (hoping to match their 1930 3rd place finish.)

I’d say he’s better than Henry at 23/24AT BEST I see no reason why he can’t be the greatest French Player ever as but I think he’ll probably need a Champions League and a couple  Ballon D’ors along with maybe another World Cup to reach that Zidane/Platini Tier. Which I’d say are all pretty are all goals that are within reach with the teams he has at Club Level and International level and the individual talent he has. He’s already on pace to SHATTER the French Goal scoring record. All he needs is longevity.In your opinion what do you guys think?

The only other ""illegal"" act that doesnt have a fk (that I can recall) is dissent and taking off your shirt, since there isn't really a spot on the field it occurred . Even unintentional fouls like offside or foul throw result in a turn over, and ""deterrent"" penalties for things like diving also include a fk.

Reddit;Mbappe is my next Messi for the next generation of great players;Messi_isGoat;2022/12/26;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zvbcz7/mbappe_is_my_next_messi_for_the_next_generation/;" Warning: Don't read part 1&2 (they're just mumbling- actually all of it)I like Mbappe. Not nearly as much (yet) but, the way I like Messi - Why I like him: I believe in his ""play style"", it's incredible to watch his high speed or shots. And I think it's RELIABLE to win him a lot individually and for his teams for year after year(just like Messi/Ronaldo), Neymar's play style could not even win him the ballon d'or, while Mbappe's definitely can/will. And just like M10/cr7, he's not prone to injury. So his future looks bright to me. I'll be rooting for him, France & PSG(messi, Barca & Arg will always be priority/favorite). I really hope if someone will SURPASS MESSI, it better be him. for someone to surpass Messi, they gotta do more than Cr7, then reach and surpass Messi. Doable considering he always got a WC (HE WON'T PROBABLY WIN 7 BALLON, MOST LIKELY MORE WORLD THO)Part 1: M10 vs CR7 style:Messi and Cr7 are good, but both have different natural way to score. Ronaldo like long shot, high Speed run, free kick, one dribble in the opponent square and shoot. While Messi may start midfield, dribble everyone to the goal, or tiki taka 1-2 1-2 until reach goalie. That's why I prefer Messi over Ronaldo: his play style is more fun to watch. I'd rather watch him dribble 5 players and score, than watch Ronaldo score long ass shot (impressive as well).And I personally think Messi's play style is more reliable than Ronaldo (probably bias) - let's say one of their team is in bad situation, I think Messi will most likely to deliver and get his team head using his play style than Ronaldo long shots.As they getting older, Ronaldo's long shots work less and less. While Messi can still somehow get himself out/aroudn 3-4 opponent with the ball (if that makes any sense). Messi's play style works better for collective, allow him to make pass decisive (and he never cares if his teammates end up scoring) . While Ronaldo's long shot doesn't( and I believe Ronaldo used to show attitude when Madrid teammate scores instead of him).I know what you thinking: Mpabbe is more like cr7, he don't dribble 4 or 5 players to score goals. It's just that I don't see anyone as the next ""Messi"" - so, for next gen of players, I'll support Mbappe.Part 2 : You're either Average good or you're Messi/CR7I have a feeling he's gonna make it to the top. Not like Neymar who had a lot of potential, and barely accomplish anything with it while years pass by. Not like any other number 9's who got into the spotlight for a couple of years but stay among the average good ones (Torres, Suarez, falcao, Giroud, forland, lewandowski, aguero, benzema•, cavani, morata, Alexi Sanchez, higuain, Van persi,...)these ARE GOOD, but not GOOD ENOUGH to shine like Messi/Ronaldo*""year after year""* [Mo Salah was seriously on the rise, But fell off] . But I believe Mbappe will be outstanding like Messi and Ronaldo Someone that can carry their team not just to victory, but to title(club and country). I believe Mbappe can carry PSG to UCL and France to WC champions(again) UNPOPULAR OPINION: HAALAND WILL STAY AVAREGE GOOD (nothing like Messi/Ronaldo, so he's no ""next anybody"", well maybe Next Zlatan. But Zlatan was also average good(maybe better, but never got UCL)."

I was shocked now slow everyone was ALL THE TIME.  The passes were also very slow, if they happened today 90$ of the passes would be intercepted. But they are not because of my next point.Pressing doesn't exist. When a team gets the ball they are [free to attack and get to about 25 meters from the opponents goal](https://youtu.be/GomTORLZcWw?t=3723) before anyone tries to take the ball away.Everyone is hyper individualistic. It's literally 1 guy that tries to dribble his way into the opposition and then shoot or pass. Combination pay doesn't exist. I watched like [8 different](https://youtu.be/GomTORLZcWw?t=2078) players [shoot 30 meters](https://youtu.be/GomTORLZcWw?t=1962) from [the goal](https://youtu.be/GomTORLZcWw?t=2122). [This](https://youtu.be/GomTORLZcWw?t=1671) is what the best free kicker in Brazil is doing in a world cup final. Literally half the shots in the game were these hopeless, talentless kicks that will make any modern coach bench a player on the spot. [And here is the most talentless of them all](https://youtu.be/GomTORLZcWw?t=3537).But the thing that brought me to thiers of laughter was the defending, or the complete there lack of.There is no team cohesion, everyone is doing their own thing with zero consideration of the players around him.There is no such thing as line of defense. You would have 1 dumb defender who just forgets to move and is 3 meters behind his teammates.There is no defensive support from the midfield. Once you get past them they will not run back to help the defenders but will sheepishly watch the attacker go 1v1 with the defender.I have no Idea how someone could claim that Pele(or Maradona) Is the best at football.Now If you want to say that he is the king of flupbol or some other made up thing, that's fine. But from my point of view what they played then and what they play now are two different games. Also in Brazil Pele used to play against people who have day jobs. Do you honestly think that the guys who play in the 12th team in the Paulista are raising families with the 20$ a month they were payed?People with low intelligence always seem to simp for the old days. The old masters are always going to be better no matter what type of thing, when the reality is that everything advancess all the time. Like 10 years ago Michael Phelps used to hold all the records in swimming, now he has 1 individual left.Edit:I see that every seccond comment is coulda, shoulda, woulda. Thinking that if Pele and Maradona had the same training as Messi and Ronaldo, they would be the Greatest.WRONG, there are a million talented players, who have modern training and who don't make it big, because of their mental lack of understanding of the complexities of the modern game. Just because you could do some tricks doesn't mean you will be a professional.Remember Robinho? Remember how talented he was? How he was the seccond comming of Pele? And how he bombed once he started playing in europe he bombed himself into oblivion.  Also to further trash Pele and Maradona  WHEN COMPARED WITH PEOPLE FROM THEIR TIME.   Pele was outperformed or outscored in every single world cup he has played 1958 Just Fontaine 13 goals | Pele 6 goals 1962 Six players tied for 4 goals | Pele 1 goal 1966 Eusébio 9 goals | Pele 1 goal 1970 Gerd Müller 10 goals | Pele 4 goals  Pele wasn't even the best player in MSL  [New York Cosmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Cosmos_(1970%E2%80%931985)). In his 3 seasons he never became the top scorer of the league.  Dont get me started with Maradona. He was never the top scorer in europe despite playing there for 10 years. He was only 2 times top scorer in HIS OWN TEAMS in europe. He never won an  Champions league (Messi 4). He was really the top assist provider in his own team (2 out of 10). Compare that with Messi who has been both the top scorer and assist provider for his teams for majority of the last 15 years. Winning 6 european golden shoes, Maradona - 0.  Messi 8 domestic golden shoes, Maradona - 0.

And 3 years since I played competitively in a league or Highschool. I played Highschool was a starting left wing/striker im 6’2 about 170 pounds. The question is can I return to the same form I was In when I was 18 or 19 in my prime? The biggest thing I noticed was gone was my fast pace and my stamina.. I did gain some weight and muscle in the past years and I was missing that when I played before. Can I return to the same pace and dribbling control I had before ? Or do I have to change my playstyle now? I would love to still be able to beat defenders on the wing and chase through balls like I used to. Any advice and tips help.

This generation is so woke man honestly, should Teves have given up his medal when he held up Rip Fergie no, it was painful as a United fan of course it was but it’s passion that we love in the game most of the time. It can go too far in both of these cases. He should be fined World Cup winnings and that’s about it. As well as a public apology to  young man, but for Unai to say he should give up his World Cup medal is ridiculous. Shithousery is part of the game but what rule did he break. A proper apology to Mbappe when he is back to normal after partying for a week in Argentina is the simple solution. He won Argentina the World Cup which is huge in South America especially after their barren spell. Yes what he did was wrong but he did nothing wrong on the pitch,and that’s all that matters. This type of football is the best to watch and as long as it’s not a brutal tackle like we saw on the Leicester young player, the worst he should get is a fine and a heartfelt apology.What are peoples thoughts?

Reddit;VAR Usage in the World Cup - A better way;Excellent-Virus-8882;2022/12/24;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zu3czz/var_usage_in_the_world_cup_a_better_way/;Amidst the drama of the Qatar World Cup including one of the best finals of all time, the human rights and corruption issues associated with the host nation and the beer ban, there is an endless list of things to reflect on. One topic which may lose the competition for attention in the wake of the World Cup is the use of VAR, and whether it has enhanced the world game. As it standsThe problem that seems to be addressed by VAR’s current iteration is injustice around the penalty box stemming from three main sources: 1) the offside rule 2) the handball rule and 3) fouls which are missed by the referee in real time. In this area, VAR adds an added layer of precision in terms of offside, with minor technical infringements of the rule being flagged. It also catches serious fouls that the referee may have missed. So what can be said for VAR is that it removes some level of arbitrariness from football. However in many ways football is a sea of randomness, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It has deflections, referee errors in the build up to a goal which are judged too remote to review, and we’ve all made what seems to be an error on the field that turns out to be in our team’s favour. One of the appeals of soccer is that it’s low scoring system makes upsets (which often have an element of luck) more frequent than other sports. So it’s not clear that reducing randomness around the penalty box makes the game a better sport for spectators. The benefit of introducing VAR, then, is uncertain. Reasonable people may disagree as to whether reducing the element of fortune in the game is a boon at all. The disadvantage, however, is clear. The technology slows down games and can lead to some fantastic goals being overturned due to having a fingernail ahead of the defender. This encourages attackers to ensure that they give defenders an extra half yard of space, and this bias will likely lead to less goals and more defensive football. While the current VAR technology is remarkable, it has a clear downside, and it’s not clear that the problems that it solves were problems in the first place.VAR as it could be While the popularity of the world game speaks for itself, there are issues with the game that have held it back, particular in “soccer” countries where football competes with the oval ball games. The low scoring nature of the game is one challenge which VAR does not seem capable of solving. However the other main problem in these regions is the pervasiveness of simulation as a means of attractive a referee’s attention. This  is certainly something that VAR could address, without interrupting the flow of the game. My proposed interim solution is to simply allow the VAR to review tackles, and hand out yellow cards when it is beyond reasonable doubt that a player has attempted to deceive a referee. As a starting point, it will be important to utilise the ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ threshold to ensure that players who have potentially been impeded do not receive a yellow card for attempting to draw a referee’s attention to that fact. However if a player is aware that the VAR will be assessing their behaviour, that behaviour is likely to change, and in quick fashion after their first yellow.The yellow card could be given at the next break in play, so there would be no interruption to the flow of play, and no consequences from the VAR intervention for the match beyond the giving of the yellow card (i.e. no free kick for the opposing team). The advantage of this approach is that by adopting a high standard of proof, there’s no real down side to experimenting with this. In my view, if FIFA view the offside rule as sufficiently serious to justify such strict adherence that putting a toe out of line is enough to disallow a goal, then it’s difficult to see why simulation should not also be policed. The A-league would be an ideal practice ground to test this application of the VAR, as fans have a very hostile reaction to simulation, and the move would undoubtably be well received by local press and fansWould be grateful for your thoughts on how VAR could be used to improve the game beyond it’s current iteration

I loved every game; there were so many surprises and unexpected outcomes. Anyway, now that it is over, I want to continue watching football, so I am currently watching the Carabao cup since yesterday. Great game between Liverpool and man city! I am concerned about sharing / discussing football with others regarding competitions outside the world cup. People are very opinionated about football, what team they support, players they like, transfers,  manager strategy, etc. I don't have this depth of knowledge and feel embarrassed about it somehow, but I enjoy watching. I'm 36 years old, by the way! 😂 I don't support a team yet; I don't feel I have enough ‘experience’ to decide which team to support, so that's also confusing to me. It feels strange to say I support Liverpool or Man U just because my friends do.. or maybe I should? Just have a common bond, perhaps. Any advice for a newbie like me? Like what are 'core' things I should know. Perhaps where I can do more research and get up to speed so I can be a 'proper man' 🤣If anyone has watched the IT crowd, I remind myself of 'Roy & Moss Pretend To like Football' especially when one of the guys asks 'so what team do you support?' Roy looks at Ham and decides West Ham 🤣"

I have a background in football when i was 11 to 16 years old. I used to be a goalie when i was 11 up to when i was 13 and switch roles to be a left midfielder. Coaches and teammates used to think i have what it takes to join pursue professional football but it all turned around when my luck ran out. now that I’m 22, i realized the what ifs of my life and career if i didn’t stop dreaming of stepping into the big leagues. You see, in my country, football wasn’t exactly the main sport and it’s usually basketball that gets all the attention and the funds from our government and the populous as a whole.So by that, things took a turn when i reached 17. I lost the spark i had once from seeing people not even batting an eye on the sport. There were few reasons actually. One is i had a very major injury resulting in breaking my arm and being told to not ever play the sport as i cause casualty on the field and on the team. That took my soul out of my body because all i ever wanted was to prove that i am a capable player who will do any training hard-work and dedication there is on football. Sadly, it was all but fantasy to me. Two is seeing the potential it has on the country which is very small. I figured that if i traveled abroad I’d have the opportunity i assume i can get. But thats when i lose the ambition, Adulting. Getting to this stage can be very dull and disappointing because you realize a lot back then when its already too late. But for some reason deep inside of me i still wanna go back to my roots and pursue even though i’d be really impossible to even be noticed by clubs as i had never touched a football after senior high 😂. I am planning to train again just to try and see if i still got that inner footballer and awaken what was once sleeping. I still want to dream but is it too late?

Argentina’s captain converted the penalty to give Argentina the lead. Next, his deft touch was key in springing the move which led to *La Albiceleste’s* second.Then in the closing stages of normal time, Mbappé single-handedly took a grip of the game, scoring two goals in two minutes and sending the final to extra time.Messi looked shot and Mbappé looked like he was just getting going.Except it was the diminutive Argentine who next popped up to score his second goal of the match and restore his team’s lead in the 109th minute.Refusing to accept defeat, Mbappé roused his teammates, scoring a second penalty to grab his hat-trick and take the final to a penalty shootout.Both Mbappé and Messi scored in the shootout but in the end – with France missing two penalties – it was the Argentina captain who was mobbed by his teammates as his World Cup dream was lived out in real time.Over two hours of soccer, these was two players – at two different points of their careers – demonstrating the beautiful game in vivid, glorious technicolor.## [messi vs mbappe](https://preview.redd.it/zksvux7bkd7a1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6858336984c16f94523d56f8834a9930f840ea78)## From the spotThe last time a World Cup final went to penalties was in 2006 when France was once again beaten, this time by Italy.Sometimes, it feels unfair to settle a game in a shootout, a series of actions between the penalty taker and the goalkeeper. However, at the Lusail Stadium on Sunday, the abundance of penalties seemed to ratchet up the pressure and tension.Messi’s penalty in the first half gave him his first World Cup final goal, while his spot kick in the shootout was coolness personified.Mbappé’s ability to not once, not twice, but three times successfully convert from the spot in one game showed extreme gumptionPreviously at Qatar 2022, one team had already experienced the intensity of that pressure cooker atmosphere and emerged the other side, and one which had not.Argentina got the better of the Netherlands in the quarterfinals in an epic which culminated in a penalty shootout, and one which saw the South American team display distraction and delaying tactics to arguably mentally monster their opponents.In Sunday’s final, Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez showing his ability to distract the French takers, throwing the ball away before Aurélien Tchouaméni attempt, which flew wide. France’s previous attempt – from Kingsley Coman – had been saved by Martinez.A penalty shootout is arguably unlike anything else in sports – it’s a modern day duel and a World Cup final with so much at stake only heightens the tension and drama.&#x200B;[martinez](https://preview.redd.it/0spnzmo6pd7a1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d4f7b5623d618adfd39dcb358dd93f706721e64)## Great goalsWorld Cup finals are often tight and cagey affairs, with goals at a premium.Argentina and France threw away that playbook – delivering six goals, two of which were of the highest quality.Argentina’s second was arguably as good as Carlos Alberto’s breathtaking goal in the 1970 World Cup final in Brazil’s 4-1 win over Italy.It was in the 35th minute, when a flick round the corner from Alexis Mac Allister to Messi, relieved some pressure on the Argentina defense as France pushed for an equalizer.After Messi’s deft touch to Julián Álvarez and the Manchester City forward’s excellently weighted pass to Mac Allister, who had continued his run, Argentina was in on goal.Unselfishly, Mac Allister had the presence of mind to square the ball to Ángel Di María who finished off a brilliant sweeping counterattack to put Argentina 2-0 upAt that point, it looked to be the crowning moment of a dominant Argentina victory, until Mbappé stepped up.After his penalty reduced the deficit to 2-1, a neat one-two with Marcus Thuram had the ball falling to the PSG star out of the sky on the edge of Argentina’s penalty area.With seemingly all the time in the world, Mbappé produced a wonderful display of technique and timing to thunder the ball past a despairing Martínez.These are the moments that capture imaginations and the moments that came to define the 2022 World Cup final.It will be remembered for so many reasons – Messi’s moment of history, Mbappé’s hat-trick in defeat, the seesaw nature of the game that oscillated from end to end and never ceased to tug on gobsmacked watchers’ emotions.Overall with its multiples story lines and the drama and artistry on display, surely the 2022 showpiece now owns the title of ‘greatest World Cup final.’&#x200B;[mbappe](https://preview.redd.it/vbpk3iq0qd7a1.jpg?width=690&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1f637e55427dfaf4438136268210c06dcb9f9ec)"

Reddit;Trying to understand Dibu's mentality;soundingdemo;2022/12/21;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zs0jf0/trying_to_understand_dibus_mentality/;There are some players who are slightly odd acting like Balotelli or Gazza. They do funny things and may lack discipline but they are also talented. I thought Dibu might fall into their category.

Reddit;There's a difference between the best footballer of all time, and the greatest of all time.;Bakahashi;2022/12/22;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zse2md/theres_a_difference_between_the_best_footballer/;Lionel Messi is the best ever to play the game. Full stop. Nobody's skills match up. Of course, it's because the game has evolved, technology, everything has evolved. Obviously, in due time there may be better players than him as well. It seems unlikely because I think he tapped into greatness very early. So, although it's possible that you'll have 30 year olds better than Messi or Ronaldo at 30, in future, but to see a 16 year old with that magic touch, very unlikely. Now, about greatness. That's a combination of quite a few things, really. Your impact on the game, on the sport. Influence on pop culture, etc. many things. I think Pele, Maradona and Messi, all are in that debate now. And that we can discuss. There we may have our subjective opinions. But as far the best footballer to have ever worn a pair of boots is concerned, Messi is the man, hands down.

Reddit;Reason for ronaldo hate?(serious);Ballsballs37;2022/12/22;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zsly7p/reason_for_ronaldo_hateserious/;"I'm confused as to why cristiano ronaldo has been hated by so many...""people""...throughout his career. I've always been neutral on the topic,not really caring about him myself, but it is really weird. A common answer would be a rapist, but this is untrue, and an example of people lying to themselves. They hated cr7 before the rape case and use it to tell themselves their hate for him comes from their good morals. So what causes an adult to let another man live in their heads rent free? What can cause someone to continually emberass themselves and sink lower and lower like this? I think the answer is an inferiority complex. People who haven't done much or are unsatisfied with their lives often look at someone who has done much with a great amount of envy. So when it comes to the messi/cr7 debate, people naturally gravitate to the one who looks like they escaped from the set of the hobbit, rather than the one who isn't shy about the gap between them and the rest of humanity. It no surprise a lot of the hate comes from the u.k, a oddly miserable nation with an bewildering inferiority complex.The ones who look at the cr7 decline with glee bring to mind a pack of hyenas surrounding a lion who is dying of old age. ""Yes, I've done nothing with my life and am deeply unhappy, but at least messi is better than ronaldo""."

Wow! What an amazing World Cup that was. I never really cared for football prior to the cup besides the casual games my buddy’s and I would play after school back in primary and secondary school, but I’m hooked and want more, but I do have some questions.Based on my small understanding of how FIFA is organized, there are “Leagues” all over the world and within those leagues there are “Clubs”. Being from Canada we are a part of the MLS with the USA correct?Now I’m pretty sure not all leagues are created equal and the leagues that most people pay attention to are England’s Premier League, France’s Ligue 1, Spain’s Laliga Santander and Germany’s Bundesliga right?Now when it comes to watching games, with a DAZN subscription would I be able to watch any league I want? Is there another subscription that’s better quality and price wise you would recommend instead of DAZN?Thank you in advance for helping me out. As a person who use to call the sport soccer and now feels more comfortable calling it football this means a lot.

That 11 British blokes could defeat a modern football club, because they tackled harder and the ball was heavier(?)I'm not crazy right, on athleticism alone after 90 minutes, Wolves would win comfortably.Right?
Reddit;Luis Suarez is the greatest striker to grace the prem;Unlikely-Fish237;2022/12/21;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zrpi48/luis_suarez_is_the_greatest_striker_to_grace_the/;43g/a in 33 games? In 13/14 season Without taking a single penalty it’s definitely the best individual season in pl history him being the greatest pl striker is debatable but who else could have matched or succeed those stats? In that Liverpool side? The same side that almost won the league title because of Suarez’s influence try and change my mind? He could link up play, dribble, and pass just as well Henry and in terms of the ‘eye test’ Suarez is king the only argument that is valid is longevity but I have no doubt he would have still been world class if he didn’t move to Barca it would be interesting to see how he would preform in Liverpool’s current squad

Some memoriable misses come to my mind every time he is about to take a PK (such as Chelsea in UCL, some in Copa America, against Real Madrid in UCL as a PSG player last year etc.) but it looks like he overcomed that ""fault"" that he had with penalties during this World Cup, he scored them so easily every time apart from Poland one but still great"

Reddit;Who has the most trophies in football history: Messi or Daniel Alves?;AntPRodP;2022/12/20;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zqm0if/who_has_the_most_trophies_in_football_history/;"When we decide to make and share ranking lists (such as, for example, one with the players with the most titles/trophies), it is very difficult for them to be consensual; they are very likely to generate debate/discussion. If FIFA were to publish an official list, the conversation would certainly be different (since, as the highest football entity, a list published by FIFA would have to be considered as the most reliable) but, in the absence of such a list, it is normal that different lists emerge.However, there are 2 aspects that must undoubtedly be taken into account when making a ranking:A) *We must explain the criteria used* (sharing a ranking list without explaining how we arrived at it is not valid).B) *There must be coherence in the construction and application of these criteria* (for example, if we count the Olympic Games for player A, we also have to count the Olympic Games for player B, obviously).But, in this particular case of the number of trophies, where can there be disparities in the construction of criteria?**1) Do only senior competitions count or do lower-level competitions also count?** Are competitions above U-19 all automatically senior? It is normal that this generates different opinions, especially the second question. It is legitimate to consider the under-20 World Cups, under-21 European Championships or the Olympic Games (under-23), despite the fact that they are not competitions played by the A National Teams.**2) Which competitions are considered official?** This one is relatively easier: just follow what FIFA says. For example, Daniel Alves has Catalan Cups and Super Cups on his resume, but FIFA does not recognize them as official.**3) Do only top-tier competitions count or should we consider trophies from lower divisions and reserve teams?** On this point, too, it is legitimate to have differences of opinion. If, for example, FIFA considers the English or Italian second division as official, why shouldn't we count them if they are part of a player's resume? But, on the other hand, is it correct to put side by side secondary/reserve cups and competitions such as a World Cup or a Champions League? There will certainly be different opinions.**4) Finally, what does a player have to do so we consider he won a certain trophy?** Does he have to play in that competition (even 1 minute)? Is it enough to have been on the game sheet at least once? Is it enough to be registered, without ever having been on the bench? Or is it enough to be part of the senior squad, regardless of whether you are registered for the competition or not (here we have the examples of players with long-term injuries)? But what does it mean to “be part of the senior squad”? Does the player have to have been introduced to the fans in the beggining of the season? Does he have to play at least 1 official game during the season in question? As we can see, it's not simple.Taking all this into account, let's analyze the cases of the 2 players with the most trophies in the history of football, regardless of the criteria used (unless there are players in Indonesia, or Taiwan, or even Burkina Faso, who have won more competitions, but don't have the attention of the media and official entities): Messi and Daniel Alves.***Messi's official senior top-tier trophies:***\--> *Trophies that don't raise any doubts:* **39** (4 Champions League; 10 Spanish Leagues; 1 French League; 7 Spanish Cups; 7 Spanish Super Cups; 1 French Super Cup; 3 European Super Cups; 3 Club World Cups; 1 World Cup; 1 Copa America; 1 Finalíssima).\--> *Trophies that must be counted if we consider competitions that, despite not being played by the National A Teams, have the participation of senior players*: **2** (1 U-20 World Cup; 1 Olympic Games).\--> *Trophies that must be counted if we consider competitions in which the player, despite being part of the squad, did not play any minute:* **1** (1 Spanish Super Cup).Therefore, in the case of Lionel Messi, we can see that, according to the criteria I have explained, the total number of top-tier official senior trophies is **39, 41 or 42**.***Daniel Alves top-tier official senior trophies:***\--> *Trophies that don't raise any doubts:* **41** (3 Champions League; 2 Europa League; 1 Brazilian Copa do Nordeste; 1 Brazilian Campeonato Paulista; 6 Spanish Leagues; 1 Italian League; 2 French Leagues; 1 Italian Cup; 1 French Cup; 1 French League Cup; 5 Spanish Super Cups; 1 French Super Cup; 5 Spanish Cups; 4 European Super Cups; 3 Club World Cups; 2 Copa America; 2 Confederations Cups)\--> *Trophies that must be counted if we consider competitions that, despite not being played by the National A Teams, have the participation of senior players*: **2** (1 U-20 World Cup; 1 Olympic Games).\--> *Trophies that must be counted if we consider competitions in which the player, despite being part of the squad, did not play any minute:* **3** (1 French Super Cup; 1 Brazilian Campeonato Baiano; 1 Brazilian Copa do Nordeste).Therefore, in the case of Daniel Alves, we can see that, according to the criteria I have explained, the total number of official senior top-tier trophies is **41, 43 or 46**.**CONCLUSION:** Daniel Alves is still number 1 in this matter. But probably not for long."

I have no hate towards Messi or that I don't like the fame he received but I just wish that the other players would also be appreciated // celebrated.

Moststudies on the transfer of football players focus on the transfer system andtransfer fees but not on the transfer behavior itself. Based on the 470,792transfer records from 1990 to 2016 among 23,605 football clubs in 206 countriesand regions, we construct a directed footballer transfer network (FTN), wherethe nodes are the football clubs and the links correspond to the footballertransfers.

We find that the in-degrees, out-degrees, in-strengths and out-strengthsof nodes follow bimodal distributions (a power law with exponential decay),while the distribution of link weights has a power-law tail. We further figureout the correlations between node degrees, node strengths and link weights. Wealso investigate the general characteristics of different measures of networkcentrality. Our network analysis of the global footballer transfer market shedsnew lights into the investigation of the characteristics of transferactivities.
ArXiv;Networks of international football: communities, evolution and  globalization of the game;Yang Li, Gonzalo Mateos;2022/05/21;http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10599v1;As the most popular sport around the globe, the game of football has recentlyintrigued much research interest to explore and distill useful and appealinginformation from the sport. Network science and graph-centric methods have beenpreviously applied to study the importance of football players and teams. Inthis paper, for the first time we study the macroscopic evolution of thefootball society from a complex network point of view. Football game recordswithin a time window of over a century were collected and expressed in a graphformat, where participant teams are represented by graph nodes and the gamesbetween them are the graph edges. We carry out community detection and temporalanalysis to reveal the dynamic features and the community structures embeddedwithin the football network, offering the evidence of a continuously expandingfootball society. Spatio-temporal analysis is also implemented to unveil thetemporal states that represent distinct development stages in the footballhistory. Our analysis suggests that the evolution of the game receivesconsiderable impact not only from major sport events, but also from multiplesocial and political incidents. The game of football and its evolution reflectsignificant historical transitions and turning points, and can provide a novelperspective for the study of the worldwide globalization process.
ArXiv;The classification of football patterns;V. Braungart, D. Kotschick;2006/06/08;http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0606193v1;We prove that every spherical football (also known as a spherical soccerball) is a branched cover, branched only in the vertices, of the standardfootball made up of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons. We also give examples showingthat the corresponding result is not true for footballs of higher genera.Moreover, we classify the possible pairs (k,l) for which football patterns onthe sphere exist satisfying a natural generalisation of the usual incidencerelation between pentagons and hexagons to k-gons and l-gons.

Rubinstein, Kewei Zhang;2019/05/02;http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00865v1;Compact Ricci solitons on surfaces have at most two cone points, and areknown as Hamilton's footballs. In this note we completely describe thedegenerations of these footballs as one or both of the cone angles approacheszero. In particular, we show that Hamilton's famous non-compact cigar solitonis the Gromov--Hausdorff limit of Hamilton's compact conical teardrop solitons.
ArXiv;Seasonal Linear Predictivity in National Football Championships;Giuseppe Jurman;2015/11/19;http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06262v1;Predicting the results of sport matches and competitions is an arisingresearch field, benefiting from the growing amount of available data and thenovel data analytics techniques. Excellent forecasts can be achieved byadvanced machine learning methods applied to detailed historical data,especially in very popular sports such as football (soccer). Here we show that,despite the large number of confounding factors, the results of a football teamin longer competitions (e.g., a national league) follow a basically lineartrend useful for predictive purposes, too. In support of this claim, we presenta set of experiments of linear regression on a database collecting the yearlyresults of 707 teams playing in 22 divisions from 11 countries, in 20 footballseasons.
ArXiv;Pricing Football Players using Neural Networks;Sourya Dey;2017/11/16;http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05865v2;We designed a multilayer perceptron neural network to predict the price of afootball (soccer) player using data on more than 15,000 players from thefootball simulation video game FIFA 2017. The network was optimized byexperimenting with different activation functions, number of neurons andlayers, learning rate and its decay, Nesterov momentum based stochasticgradient descent, L2 regularization, and early stopping. Simultaneousexploration of various aspects of neural network training is performed andtheir trade-offs are investigated. Our final model achieves a top-5 accuracy of87.2% among 119 pricing categories, and places any footballer within 6.32% ofhis actual price on average.
ArXiv;Predictive modelling of football injuries;Stylianos Kampakis;2016/09/20;http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07480v1;The goal of this thesis is to investigate the potential of predictivemodelling for football injuries. This work was conducted in close collaborationwith Tottenham Hotspurs FC (THFC), the PGA European tour and the participationof Wolverhampton Wanderers (WW).  Three investigations were conducted:  1. Predicting the recovery time of football injuries using the UEFA injuryrecordings: The UEFA recordings is a common standard for recording injuries inprofessional football. For this investigation, three datasets of UEFA injuryrecordings were available. Different machine learning algorithms were used inorder to build a predictive model. The performance of the machine learningmodels is then improved by using feature selection conducted throughcorrelation-based subset feature selection and random forests.  2. Predicting injuries in professional football using exposure records: Therelationship between exposure (in training hours and match hours) inprofessional football athletes and injury incidence was studied. A commonproblem in football is understanding how the training schedule of an athletecan affect the chance of him getting injured. The task was to predict thenumber of days a player can train before he gets injured.  3. Predicting intrinsic injury incidence using in-training GPS measurements:A significant percentage of football injuries can be attributed to overtrainingand fatigue. GPS data collected during training sessions might provideindicators of fatigue, or might be used to detect very intense trainingsessions which can lead to overtraining. This research used GPS data gatheredduring training sessions of the first team of THFC, in order to predict whetheran injury would take place during a week.
ArXiv;Explaining the difference between men's and women's football;Luca Pappalardo, Alessio Rossi, Giuseppe Pontillo, Michela Natilli, Paolo Cintia;2021/01/05;http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01662v1;Women's football is gaining supporters and practitioners worldwide, raisingquestions about what the differences are with men's football. While the twosports are often compared based on the players' physical attributes, we analyzethe spatio-temporal events during matches in the last World Cups to comparemale and female teams based on their technical performance. We train anartificial intelligence model to recognize if a team is male or female based onvariables that describe a match's playing intensity, accuracy, and performancequality. Our model accurately distinguishes between men's and women's football,revealing crucial technical differences, which we investigate through theextraction of explanations from the classifier's decisions. The differencesbetween men's and women's football are rooted in play accuracy, the recoverytime of ball possession, and the players' performance quality. Our methodologymay help journalists and fans understand what makes women's football a distinctsport and coaches design tactics tailored to female teams.
ArXiv;How does AI play football? An analysis of RL and real-world football  strategies;Atom Scott, Keisuke Fujii, Masaki Onishi;2021/11/24;http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12340v1;Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have made it possible todevelop sophisticated agents that excel in a wide range of applications.Simulations using such agents can provide valuable information in scenariosthat are difficult to scientifically experiment in the real world. In thispaper, we examine the play-style characteristics of football RL agents anduncover how strategies may develop during training. The learnt strategies arethen compared with those of real football players. We explore what can belearnt from the use of simulated environments by using aggregated statisticsand social network analysis (SNA). As a result, we found that (1) there arestrong correlations between the competitiveness of an agent and various SNAmetrics and (2) aspects of the RL agents play style become similar to realworld footballers as the agent becomes more competitive. We discuss furtheradvances that may be necessary to improve our understanding necessary to fullyutilise RL for the analysis of football.
ArXiv;Machine Learning Modeling to Evaluate the Value of Football Players;Chenyao Li, Stylianos Kampakis, Philip Treleaven;2022/07/22;http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11361v1;In most sports, especially football, most coaches and analysts search for keyperformance indicators using notational analysis. This method utilizes astatistical summary of events based on video footage and numerical records ofgoal scores. Unfortunately, this approach is now obsolete owing to thecontinuous evolutionary increase in technology that simplifies the analysis ofmore complex process variables through machine learning (ML). Machine learning,a form of artificial intelligence (AI), uses algorithms to detect meaningfulpatterns and define a structure based on positional data. This researchinvestigates a new method to evaluate the value of current football players,based on establishing the machine learning models to investigate the relationsamong the various features of players, the salary of players, and the marketvalue of players. The data of the football players used for this project isfrom several football websites. The data on the salary of football players willbe the proxy for evaluating the value of players, and other features will beused to establish and train the ML model for predicting the suitable salary forthe players. The motivation is to explore what are the relations betweendifferent features of football players and their salaries - how each featureaffects their salaries, or which are the most important features to affect thesalary? Although many standards can reflect the value of football players, thesalary of the players is one of the most intuitive and crucial indexes, so thisstudy will use the salary of players as the proxy to evaluate their value.Moreover, many features of players can affect the valuation of the footballplayers, but the value of players is mainly decided by three types of factors:basic characteristics, performance on the court, and achievements at the club.
ArXiv;On the flight of an American Football;Curtis Horn, Heidi Fearn;2007/06/04;http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0366v1;In this paper we examine the detailed theory of the American football inflight, with spin and air resistance included. We find the theory has much incommon with the theory of a gyroscope and also rocket trajectory with amisaligned thruster. Unfortunately most of the air resistance data, forrocketry and ballistics, is for speeds of Mach 1 or higher, where the airresistance increases dramatically. We shall approximate a realistic airresistance, at the slower speeds of football flight, with a drag forceproportional to cross sectional area and either $v$ or $v^2$, depending onspeed, where $v$ is velocity of the football. We begin with a discussion of themotion, giving as much detail as possible without the use of complex analyticcalculations. We point out the previous errors made with moments of inertia andmake the necessary corrections for more accurate results. We show that theshape of an American football closely resembles a parabola of revolution.
ArXiv;Using Twitter to predict football outcomes;Stylianos Kampakis, Andreas Adamides;2014/11/05;http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1243v1;Twitter has been proven to be a notable source for predictive modelling onvarious domains such as the stock market, the dissemination of diseases orsports outcomes. However, such a study has not been conducted in football(soccer) so far. The purpose of this research was to study whether data minedfrom Twitter can be used for this purpose. We built a set of predictive modelsfor the outcome of football games of the English Premier League for a 3 monthperiod based on tweets and we studied whether these models can overcomepredictive models which use only historical data and simple footballstatistics. Moreover, combined models are constructed using both Twitter andhistorical data. The final results indicate that data mined from Twitter canindeed be a useful source for predicting games in the Premier League. The finalTwitter-based model performs significantly better than chance when measured byCohen's kappa and is comparable to the model that uses simple statistics andhistorical data. Combining both models raises the performance higher than itwas achieved by each individual model. Thereby, this study provides evidencethat Twitter derived features can indeed provide useful information for theprediction of football (soccer) outcomes.

The resulting environment is challenging, easy touse and customize, and it is available under a permissive open-source license.In addition, it provides support for multiplayer and multi-agent experiments.We propose three full-game scenarios of varying difficulty with the FootballBenchmarks and report baseline results for three commonly used reinforcementalgorithms (IMPALA, PPO, and Ape-X DQN). We also provide a diverse set ofsimpler scenarios with the Football Academy and showcase several promisingresearch directions.
ArXiv;A mathematical take on the competitive balance of a football league;Soudeep Deb;2021/02/18;http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09288v1;Competitive balance in a football league is extremely important from theperspective of economic growth of the industry. Many researchers have earlierproposed different measures of competitive balance, which are primarily adaptedfrom the standard economic theory. However, these measures fail to capture thefiner nuances of the game. In this work, we discuss a new framework which ismore suitable for a football league. First, we present a mathematical proof ofan ideal situation where a football league becomes perfectly balanced. Next, agoal based index for competitive balance is developed. We present relevanttheoretical results and show how the proposed index can be used to formallytest for the presence of imbalance. The methods are implemented on the datafrom top five European leagues, and it shows that the new approach can betterexplain the changes in the seasonal competitive balance of the leagues.Further, using appropriate panel data models, we show that the proposed indexis more suitable to analyze the variability in total revenues of the footballleagues.
ArXiv;Stochastic model for football's collective dynamics;A. Chacoma, N. Almeira, J. I. Perotti, O. V. Billoni;2021/04/20;http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10272v2;In this paper, we study collective interaction dynamics emerging in the gameof football-soccer. To do so, we surveyed a database containing body-sensorstraces measured during three professional football matches, where we observedstatistical patterns that we used to propose a stochastic model for theplayers' motion in the field. The model, which is based on linear interactions,captures in good approximation the spatiotemporal dynamics of a football team.Our theoretical framework, therefore, becomes an effective analytical tool touncover the underlying cooperative mechanisms behind the complexity of footballplays. Moreover, we showed that it can provide handy theoretical support forcoaches to evaluate teams' and players' performances in both training sessionsand competitive scenarios.
ArXiv;A Bayesian Mean-Value Approach with a Self-Consistently Determined Prior  Distribution for the Ranking of College Football Teams;James R. Ashburn, Paul M. Colvert;2006/07/07;http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0607064v2;We introduce a Bayesian mean-value approach for ranking all college footballteams using only win-loss data. This approach is unique in that the priordistribution necessary to handle undefeated and winless teams is calculatedself-consistently. Furthermore, we will show statistics supporting the validityof the prior distribution. Finally, a brief comparison with other footballrankings will be presented.
ArXiv;Statistics of football dynamics;R. S. Mendes, L. C. Malacarne, C. Anteneodo;2007/06/12;http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1758v1;We investigate the dynamics of football matches. Our goal is to characterizestatistically the temporal sequence of ball movements in this collective sportgame, searching for traits of complex behavior. Data were collected over avariety of matches in South American, European and World championshipsthroughout 2005 and 2006. We show that the statistics of ball touches presentspower-law tails and can be described by $q$-gamma distributions. To explainsuch behavior we propose a model that provides information on thecharacteristics of football dynamics. Furthermore, we discuss the statistics ofduration of out-of-play intervals, not directly related to the previousscenario.
ArXiv;Comparing probabilistic predictive models applied to football;Marcio A. Diniz, Rafael Izbicki, Danilo Lopes, Luis Ernesto Salasar;2017/05/11;http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04356v1;We propose two Bayesian multinomial-Dirichlet models to predict the finaloutcome of football (soccer) matches and compare them to three well-knownmodels regarding their predictive power. All the models predicted the full-timeresults of 1710 matches of the first division of the Brazilian footballchampionship and the comparison used three proper scoring rules, the proportionof errors and a calibration assessment. We also provide a goodness of fitmeasure. Our results show that multinomial-Dirichlet models are not onlycompetitive with standard approaches, but they are also well calibrated andpresent reasonable goodness of fit.
ArXiv;Combining historical data and bookmakers'odds in modelling football  scores;Leonardo Egidi, Francesco Pauli, Nicola Torelli;2018/02/24;http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08848v1;Modelling football outcomes has gained increasing attention, in large partdue to the potential for making substantial profits. Despite the strongconnection existing between football models and the bookmakers' betting odds,no authors have used the latter for improving the fit and the predictiveaccuracy of these models. We have developed a hierarchical Bayesian Poissonmodel in which the scoring rates of the teams are convex combinations ofparameters estimated from historical data and the additional source of thebetting odds. We apply our analysis to a nine-year dataset of the most popularEuropean leagues in order to predict match outcomes for their tenth seasons. Inthis paper, we provide numerical and graphical checks for our model.
ArXiv;Distinguishing Between Roles of Football Players in Play-by-play Match  Event Data;Bart Aalbers, Jan Van Haaren;2018/09/13;http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05173v1;Over the last few decades, the player recruitment process in professionalfootball has evolved into a multi-billion industry and has thus become of vitalimportance. To gain insights into the general level of their candidatereinforcements, many professional football clubs have access to extensive videofootage and advanced statistics. However, the question whether a given playerwould fit the team's playing style often still remains unanswered. In thispaper, we aim to bridge that gap by proposing a set of 21 player roles andintroducing a method for automatically identifying the most applicable rolesfor each player from play-by-play event data collected during matches.
ArXiv;Bayesian estimation of in-game home team win probability for Division-I  FBS college football;Jason T. Maddox, Ryan Sides, Jane L.

Models forestimating these are presented and compared. These, along with other predictorsare introduced into two Bayesian approaches for the final estimate of in-gamehome-team win probability. To illustrate utility, methods are applied to the2021 Big XII Conference Football Championship game between Baylor and OklahomaState.
ArXiv;nflWAR: A Reproducible Method for Offensive Player Evaluation in  Football;Ronald Yurko, Samuel Ventura, Maksim Horowitz;2018/02/03;http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00998v2;Unlike other major professional sports, American football lacks comprehensivestatistical ratings for player evaluation that are both reproducible and easilyinterpretable in terms of game outcomes. Existing methods for player evaluationin football depend heavily on proprietary data, are not reproducible, and lagbehind those of other major sports. We present four contributions to the studyof football statistics in order to address these issues. First, we develop theR package nflscrapR to provide easy access to publicly available play-by-playdata from the National Football League (NFL) dating back to 2009. Second, weintroduce a novel multinomial logistic regression approach for estimating theexpected points for each play. Third, we use the expected points as input intoa generalized additive model for estimating the win probability for each play.Fourth, we introduce our nflWAR framework, using multilevel models to isolatethe contributions of individual offensive skill players, and providingestimates for their individual wins above replacement (WAR). We estimate theuncertainty in each player's WAR through a resampling approach specificallydesigned for football, and we present these results for the 2017 NFL season. Wediscuss how our reproducible WAR framework, built entirely on publiclyavailable data, can be easily extended to estimate WAR for players at anyposition, provided that researchers have access to data specifying whichplayers are on the field during each play. Finally, we discuss the potentialimplications of this work for NFL teams.
ArXiv;Protocol for an Observational Study of the Association of High School  Football Participation on Health in Late Adulthood;Timothy G. Gaulton, Sameer K. Deshpande, Dylan S. Small, Mark D. Neuman;2019/02/26;http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10106v1;American football is the most popular high school sport and is among theleading cause of injury among adolescents. While there has been considerablerecent attention on the link between football and cognitive decline, there isalso evidence of higher than expected rates of pain, obesity, and lower qualityof life among former professional players, either as a result of repetitivehead injury or through different mechanisms. Previously hidden downstreameffects of playing football may have far-reaching public health implicationsfor participants in youth and high school football programs.  Our proposed study is a retrospective observational study that compares 1,153high school males who played varsity football with 2,751 male students who didnot. 1,951 of the control subjects did not play any sport and the remaining 800controls played a non-contact sport. Our primary outcome is self-rated healthmeasured at age 65. To control for potential confounders, we adjust forpre-exposure covariates with matching and model-based covariance adjustment. Wewill conduct an ordered testing procedure designed to use the full pool of2,751 controls while also controlling for possible unmeasured differencesbetween students who played sports and those who did not. We willquantitatively assess the sensitivity of the results to potential unmeasuredconfounding. The study will also assess secondary outcomes of pain, difficultywith activities of daily living, and obesity, as these are both important toindividual well-being and have public health relevance.
ArXiv;Going Deep: Models for Continuous-Time Within-Play Valuation of Game  Outcomes in American Football with Tracking Data;Ronald Yurko, Francesca Matano, Lee F. Richardson, Nicholas Granered, Taylor Pospisil, Konstantinos Pelechrinis, Samuel L. Ventura;2019/06/05;http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01760v3;Continuous-time assessments of game outcomes in sports have becomeincreasingly common in the last decade. In American football, onlydiscrete-time estimates of play value were possible, since the most advancedpublic football datasets were recorded at the play-by-play level. Whilemeasures such as expected points and win probability are useful for evaluatingfootball plays and game situations, there has been no research into how thesevalues change throughout the course of a play. In this work, we make two maincontributions: First, we introduce a general framework for continuous-timewithin-play valuation in the National Football League using player-trackingdata. Our modular framework incorporates several modular sub-models, to easilyincorporate recent work involving player tracking data in football. Second, weuse a long short-term memory recurrent neural network to construct aball-carrier model to estimate how many yards the ball-carrier is expected togain from their current position, conditional on the locations and trajectoriesof the ball-carrier, their teammates and opponents. Additionally, wedemonstrate an extension with conditional density estimation so that theexpectation of any measure of play value can be calculated in continuous-time,which was never before possible at such a granular level.
ArXiv;FootApp: an AI-Powered System for Football Match Annotation;Silvio Barra, Salvatore M. Carta, Alessandro Giuliani, Alessia Pisu, Alessandro Sebastian Podda, DanieleRiboni;2021/03/04;http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02938v1;In the last years, scientific and industrial research has experienced agrowing interest in acquiring large annotated data sets to train artificialintelligence algorithms for tackling problems in different domains. In thiscontext, we have observed that even the market for football data hassubstantially grown. The analysis of football matches relies on the annotationof both individual players' and team actions, as well as the athleticperformance of players. Consequently, annotating football events at afine-grained level is a very expensive and error-prone task. Most existingsemi-automatic tools for football match annotation rely on cameras and computervision. However, those tools fall short in capturing team dynamics, and inextracting data of players who are not visible in the camera frame. To addressthese issues, in this manuscript we present FootApp, an AI-based system forfootball match annotation. First, our system relies on an advanced and mixeduser interface that exploits both vocal and touch interaction. Second, themotor performance of players is captured and processed by applying machinelearning algorithms to data collected from inertial sensors worn by players.Artificial intelligence techniques are then used to check the consistency ofgenerated labels, including those regarding the physical activity of players,to automatically recognize annotation errors. Notably, we implemented a fullprototype of the proposed system, performing experiments to show itseffectiveness in a real-world adoption scenario.
ArXiv;Deep Learning-based Automatic Player Identification and Logging in  American Football Videos;Hongshan Liu, Colin Aderon, Noah Wagon, Huapu Liu, Steven MacCall, Yu Gan;2022/04/26;http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13809v1;American football games attract significant worldwide attention every year.Game analysis systems generate crucial information that can help analyze thegames by providing fans and coaches with a convenient means to track andevaluate player performance. Identifying participating players in each play isalso important for the video indexing of player participation per play.Processing football game video presents challenges such as crowded setting,distorted objects, and imbalanced data for identifying players, especiallyjersey numbers. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based football videoanalysis system to automatically track players and index their participationper play. It is a multi-stage network design to highlight area of interest andidentify jersey number information with high accuracy. First, we utilize anobject detection network, a detection transformer, to tackle the playerdetection problem in crowded context. Second, we identify players using jerseynumber recognition with a secondary convolutional neural network, thensynchronize it with a game clock subsystem. Finally, the system outputs acomplete log in a database for play indexing. We demonstrate the effectivenessand reliability of player identification and the logging system by analyzingthe qualitative and quantitative results on football videos. The proposedsystem shows great potential for implementation in and analysis of footballbroadcast video.

We do so using only the thirty-year record of whichvisiting teams played which home teams, on what date, and what the final scorewas. No real ""statistics"" are used. The method works best in basketball, likelybecause it is high-scoring and has long seasons. It works better in footballand hockey than in baseball, but in baseball the predictions are closer to atheoretical optimum. The football predictions, while good, can in principle bemade much better, and the hockey predictions can be made somewhat better. Thesefindings tells us that in basketball, most statistics are subsumed by thescores of the games, whereas in football, further study of game and playerstatistics is necessary to predict games as well as can be done. Baseball andhockey lie somewhere in between."

ArXiv;Identifying top football players and springboard clubs from a football  player collaboration and club transfer networks;Matic Tribušon, Matevž Lenič;2016/02/11;http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03664v1;We consider all players and clubs in top twenty world football leagues in thelast fifteen seasons. The purpose of this paper is to reveal top footballplayers and identify springboard clubs. To do that, we construct two separateweighted networks. Player collaboration network consists of players, that areconnected to each other if they ever played together at the same club. Indirected club transfer network, clubs are connected if players were evertransferred from one club to another. To get meaningful results, we performdifferent network analysis methods on our networks. Our approach based onPageRank reveals Christiano Ronaldo as the top player. Using a variation ofbetweenness centrality, we identify Standard Liege as the best springboardclub.
ArXiv;Rating evaluation of sports development efficiency using statistical  analysis: evidence from Russian football;Ilya Solntsev, Anatoly Vorobyev, Elnura Irmatova, Nikita Osokin;2016/12/22;http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07543v1;Increasing investments into various dimensions of sports draw a significantamount of attention to the way these resources are being managed and whichorganizations achieve development goals with higher efficiency. This paperreviews the methodology of designing an efficiency rating model for assessingsports entities, focusing on the experience of Russian football. The RussianRegional Efficiency of Football Development model aims to evaluate the regionalfederations of the Football Union of Russian via 5 dimensions. The scoringmethod of the model is based on the three-sigma rule of distribution. Supportfactors in the form of population density and climate were also included, sinceRussian regions significantly differentiate in these aspects. The findings ofthis paper showcased that not a single region was able to achieve a maximum 5-star rating, while regions set to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup did not scorebetter compared to others. In conclusion the authors provide varioussuggestions on further developing and implementing rating models within globalsports organizations.

Priorstudies based on small datasets and manual coding show that such theatricsevince commentator bias in sports broadcasts. To examine this phenomenon, weassemble FOOTBALL, which contains 1,455 broadcast transcripts from Americanfootball games across six decades that are automatically annotated with 250Kplayer mentions and linked with racial metadata. We identify major confoundingfactors for researchers examining racial bias in FOOTBALL, and perform acomputational analysis that supports conclusions from prior social sciencestudies.
ArXiv;Maximizing performance with an eye on the finances: a chance-constrained  model for football transfer market decisions;Giovanni Pantuso, Lars Magnus Hvattum;2019/11/10;http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04689v2;Composing a team of professional players is among the most crucial decisionsin association football. Nevertheless, transfer market decisions are oftenbased on myopic objectives and are questionable from a financial point of view.This paper introduces a chance-constrained model to provide analytic support toclub managers during transfer windows. The model seeks a top-performing teamwhile adapting to different budgets and financial-risk profiles. In addition,it provides a new rating system that is able to numerically reflect theon-field performance of football players and thus contribute to an objectiveassessment of football players. The model and rating system are tested on acase study based on real market data. The data from the case study areavailable online for the benefit of future research.
ArXiv;Football tracking networks: Beyond event-based connectivity;J. M. Buldu, D. Garrido, D. R. Antequera, J. Busquets, E. Estrada, R. Resta, R. Lopez del Campo;2020/11/11;http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06014v1;We propose using Network Science as a complementary tool to analyze playerand team behavior during a football match. Specifically, we introduce fourkinds of networks based on different ways of interaction between players. Ourapproach's main novelty is to use tracking datasets to create football trackingnetworks, instead of constructing and analyzing the traditional networks basedon events. In this way, we are able to capture player interactions that gobeyond passes and introduce the concepts of (a) Ball Flow Networks, (b) MarkingNetworks, (c) Signed Proximity Networks and (d) Functional CoordinationNetworks. After defining the methodology for creating each kind of network, weshow some examples using tracking datasets from four different matches ofLaLiga Santander. Finally, we discuss some of the applications, limitations,and further improvements of football tracking networks.
ArXiv;Bisecting for selecting: using a Laplacian eigenmaps clustering approach  to create the new European football Super League;A. J. Bond, C. B. Beggs;2021/04/20;http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10125v1;We use European football performance data to select teams to form theproposed European football Super League, using only unsupervised techniques. Wefirst used random forest regression to select important variables predictinggoal difference, which we used to calculate the Euclidian distances betweenteams. Creating a Laplacian eigenmap, we bisected the Fielder vector toidentify the five major European football leagues' natural clusters. Ourresults showed how an unsupervised approach could successfully identify fourclusters based on five basic performance metrics: shots, shots on target, shotsconceded, possession, and pass success. The top two clusters identify thoseteams who dominate their respective leagues and are the best candidates tocreate the most competitive elite super league.
ArXiv;Partially Constrained Group Variable Selection to Adjust for  Complementary Unit Performance in American College Football;Andrey Skripnikov;2022/10/22;http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12519v1;Given the importance of accurate team rankings in American college football(CFB) -- due to heavy title and playoff implications -- strides have been madeto improve evaluation metrics across statistical categories, going from basicaverages (e.g. points scored per game) to metrics that adjust for a team'sstrength of schedule, but one aspect that hasn't been emphasized is thecomplementary nature of American football. Despite the same team's offensiveand defensive units typically consisting of separate player sets, some aspectsof your team's defensive (offensive) performance may affect the complementaryside: turnovers forced by your defense could lead to easier scoring chances foryour offense, while your offense's ability to control the clock may help yourdefense. For 2009-2019 CFB seasons, we incorporate natural splines with grouppenalty approaches to identify the most consistently influential features ofcomplementary football in a data-driven way, conducting partially constrainedoptimization in order to additionally guarantee the full adjustment forstrength of schedule and homefield factor. We touch on the issues arising dueto reverse-causal nature of certain within-game dynamics, discussing severalpotential remedies. Lastly, game outcome prediction performances are comparedacross several ranking adjustment approaches for method validation purposes.
ArXiv;Diversity is Key: Fantasy football dream teams under budget constraints;Josef Gullholm, Jil Klünder, Julie Rowlett, Jonathan Stålberg;2022/11/04;http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02417v1;Imagine you are managing a football team and have a fixed budget forsalaries. Which players should you draft for your team? We investigated thisquestion using the wealth of data available from fantasy premier leaguefootball (soccer). Using the players' data from past seasons, for severalseasons and several different budget constraints, we identified the highestscoring fantasy team for each season subject to each budget constraint. We theninvestigated quantifiable characteristics of these teams. Interesting, acrossnearly every variable that is significant to the game of football and thebudget, these top teams display diversity across these variables. Our resultsindicate that diversity is a general feature of top performing teams.

Therefore, it is very important toidentify the right parameters to monitor to predict market value. The followingpaper aims at determining the relevant features that successfully forecastfuture value for football players. Success is measured against their marketvalue from TransferMarkt. To select prominent features, we use Lassoregressions and Random Forest algorithms. Some obvious variables are selectedbut we also observe some subtle dependencies between features and future marketvalue. Finally, we rank the Golden Boy nominees using our forecasts and showour methodology can successfully compare football players based on theirquality.
ArXiv;Football fever: goal distributions and non-Gaussian statistics;Elmar Bittner, Andreas Nussbaumer, Wolfhard Janke, Martin Weigel;2006/06/01;http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0606016v1;Analyzing football score data with statistical techniques, we investigate howthe not purely random, but highly co-operative nature of the game is reflectedin averaged properties such as the probability distributions of scored goalsfor the home and away teams. As it turns out, especially the tails of thedistributions are not well described by the Poissonian or binomial modelresulting from the assumption of uncorrelated random events. Instead, a goodeffective description of the data is provided by less basic distributions suchas the negative binomial one or the probability densities of extreme valuestatistics. To understand this behavior from a microscopical point of view,however, no waiting time problem or extremal process need be invoked. Instead,modifying the Bernoulli random process underlying the Poissonian model toinclude a simple component of self-affirmation seems to describe the datasurprisingly well and allows to understand the observed deviation from Gaussianstatistics. The phenomenological distributions used before can be understood asspecial cases within this framework. We analyzed historical football score datafrom many leagues in Europe as well as from international tournaments,including data from all past tournaments of the ``FIFA World Cup'' series, andfound the proposed models to be applicable rather universally. In particular,here we analyse the results of the German women's premier football league andconsider the two separate German men's premier leagues in the East and Westduring the cold war times and the unified league after 1990 to see how scoringin football and the component of self-affirmation depend on cultural andpolitical circumstances.
ArXiv;Which Football Player Bears Most Resemblance to Messi? A Statistical  Analysis;Jiri Mazurek;2018/02/03;http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00967v1;Many pundits and fans ask themselves the same question: Which football playerbears most resemblance to Lionel Messi? Is it Chelsea's Eden Hazard? Is itPaulo Dybala, the heir to Messi in the national team of Argentina? Or is themost alike player to Messi someone completely else? In general, the research onthe evaluation of players' performances originated in the context of baseballin the USA, but, currently, it is of great importance in almost every teamsport on the planet. Specifically, football clubs' managers can use the data onplayer's similarity when looking for replacement of their players by other,presumably similar ones. Also, the research in the presented direction iscertainly interesting both for football pundits and football fans. Therefore,the aim of this study is to answer the question from the title with the use ofthe statistical analysis based on the data from ongoing league season retrievedfrom WhoScored (WS) database. WS provides detailed data (up to 24 parameterssuch as goals scored, the number of assists, shots on goal, passes, dribbles orfouls) for players of TOP 5 European leagues, and ranks them with respect totheir overall performance. For this study, 17 parameters (criteria) mostrelevant for an attacking player were used, and a set of 28 players, candidatesto be 'most alike to Messi' from WS TOP 100 list were selected. After datanormalization and application of a proper metric function the most similarplayer to Lionel Messi was found.

On the one hand, playing football has become a high-incomeprofession and the players are highly motivated; on the other hand, strongerteams have higher incomes and therefore afford better players leading to aneven stronger appearance in tournaments that can make the game more imbalancedand hence predictable. To quantify and document this observation, in this workwe take a minimalist network science approach to measure the predictability offootball over 26 years in major European leagues. We show that over time, thegames in major leagues have indeed become more predictable. We provide furthersupport for this observation by showing that inequality between teams hasincreased and the home-field advantage has been vanishing ubiquitously. We donot include any direct analysis on the effects of monetization on football'spredictability or therefore, lack of excitement, however, we propose severalhypotheses which could be tested in future analyses."
ArXiv;Genre determining prediction: Non-standard TAM marking in football  language;Jakob Egetenmeyer;2021/06/30;http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15872v1;German and French football language display tense-aspect-mood (TAM) formswhich differ from the TAM use in other genres. In German football talk, thepresent indicative may replace the pluperfect subjunctive. In French reports offootball matches, the imperfective past may occur instead of a perfective pasttense-aspect form. We argue that the two phenomena share a functional core andare licensed in the same way, which is a direct result of the genre they occurin. More precisely, football match reports adhere to a precise script andspecific events are temporally determined in terms of objective time. Thisallows speakers to exploit a secondary function of TAM forms, namely, theyshift the temporal perspective. We argue that it is on the grounds of the genrethat comprehenders predict the deviating forms and are also able to decodethem. We present various corpus studies where we explore the functioning ofthese phenomena in order to gain insights into their distribution,grammaticalization and their functioning in discourse. Relevant factors areAktionsart properties, rhetorical relations and their interaction with otherTAM forms. This allows us to discuss coping mechanisms on the part of thecomprehender. We broaden our understanding of the phenomena, which have onlybeen partly covered for French and up to now seem to have been ignored inGerman.
ArXiv;Automatic event detection in football using tracking data;Ferran Vidal-Codina, Nicolas Evans, Bahaeddine El Fakir, Johsan Billingham;2022/02/01;http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00804v3;"One of the main shortcomings of event data in football, which has beenextensively used for analytics in the recent years, is that it still requiresmanual collection, thus limiting its availability to a reduced number oftournaments. In this work, we propose a deterministic decision tree-basedalgorithm to automatically extract football events using tracking data, whichconsists of two steps: (1) a possession step that evaluates which player was inpossession of the ball at each frame in the tracking data, as well as thedistinct player configurations during the time intervals where the ball is notin play to inform set piece detection; (2) an event detection step thatcombines the changes in ball possession computed in the first step with thelaws of football to determine in-game events and set pieces. The automaticallygenerated events are benchmarked against manually annotated events and we showthat in most event categories the proposed methodology achieves $+90\%$detection rate across different tournaments and tracking data providers.Finally, we demonstrate how the contextual information offered by tracking datacan be leveraged to increase the granularity of auto-detected events, andexhibit how the proposed framework may be used to conduct a myriad of dataanalyses in football."
ArXiv;Graph Neural Network based Agent in Google Research Football;Yizhan Niu, Jinglong Liu, Yuhao Shi, Jiren Zhu;2022/04/23;http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11142v1;Deep neural networks (DNN) can approximate value functions or policies forreinforcement learning, which makes the reinforcement learning algorithms morepowerful. However, some DNNs, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN),cannot extract enough information or take too long to obtain enough featuresfrom the inputs under specific circumstances of reinforcement learning. Forexample, the input data of Google Research Football, a reinforcement learningenvironment which trains agents to play football, is the small map of players'locations. The information is contained not only in the coordinates of players,but also in the relationships between different players. CNNs can neitherextract enough information nor take too long to train. To address this issue,this paper proposes a deep q-learning network (DQN) with a graph neural network(GNN) as its model. The GNN transforms the input data into a graph which betterrepresents the football players' locations so that it extracts more informationof the interactions between different players. With two GNNs to approximate itslocal and target value functions, this DQN allows players to learn from theirexperience by using value functions to see the prospective value of eachintended action. The proposed model demonstrated the power of GNN in thefootball game by outperforming other DRL models with significantly fewer steps.
ArXiv;Explainable expected goal models for performance analysis in football  analytics;Mustafa Cavus, Przemysław Biecek;2022/06/14;http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07212v2;The expected goal provides a more representative measure of the team andplayer performance which also suit the low-scoring nature of football insteadof score in modern football. The score of a match involves randomness and oftenmay not represent the performance of the teams and players, therefore it hasbeen popular to use the alternative statistics in recent years such as shots ontarget, ball possessions, and drills. To measure the probability of a shotbeing a goal by the expected goal, several features are used to train anexpected goal model which is based on the event and tracking football data. Theselection of these features, the size and date of the data, and the model whichare used as the parameters that may affect the performance of the model. Usingblack-box machine learning models for increasing the predictive performance ofthe model decreases its interpretability that causes the loss of informationthat can be gathered from the model. This paper proposes an accurate expectedgoal model trained consisting of 315,430 shots from seven seasons between2014-15 and 2020-21 of the top-five European football leagues. Moreover, thismodel is explained by using explainable artificial intelligence tool to obtainan explainable expected goal model for evaluating a team or player performance.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that demonstrates apractical application of an explainable artificial intelligence tool aggregatedprofiles to explain a group of observations on an accurate expected goal modelfor monitoring the team and player performance. Moreover, these methods can begeneralized to other sports branches.
ArXiv;Protocol for an observational study on the effects of playing football  in adolescence on mental health in early adulthood;Sameer K. Deshpande, Raiden B. Hasegawa, Jordan Weiss, Dylan S. Small;2018/08/12;http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03934v2;More than 1 million students play high school American football annually, butmany health professionals have recently questioned its safety or called for itsban. These concerns have been partially driven by reports of chronic traumaticencephalopathy (CTE), increased risks of neurodegenerative disease, andassociations between concussion history and later-life cognitive impairment anddepression among retired professional football players.  A recent observational study of a cohort of men who graduated from aWisconsin high school in 1957 found no statistically significant harmfuleffects of playing high school football on a range of cognitive, psychological,and socio-economic outcomes measured at ages 35, 54, 65, and 72. Unfortunately,these findings may not generalize to younger populations, thanks to changes andimprovements in football helmet technology and training techniques. Inparticular, these changes may have led to increased perceptions of safety butultimately more dangerous styles of play, characterized by the frequentsub-concussive impacts thought to be associated with later-life neurologicaldecline.  In this work, we replicate the methodology of that earlier matchedobservational study using data from the National Longitudinal Study ofAdolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). These include adolescent and familyco-morbidities, academic experience, self-reported levels of general health andphysical activity, and the score on the Add Health Picture Vocabulary Test. Ourprimary outcome is the CES-D score measured in 2008 when subjects were aged 24-- 34 and settling into early adulthood. We also examine several secondaryoutcomes related to physical and psychological health, including suicidality.Our results can provide insight into the natural history of potentialfootball-related decline and dysfunction.

More recently, AItechniques have been applied to football, due to a huge increase in datacollection by professional teams, increased computational power, and advancesin machine learning, with the goal of better addressing new scientificchallenges involved in the analysis of both individual players' and coordinatedteams' behaviors. The research challenges associated with predictive andprescriptive football analytics require new developments and progress at theintersection of statistical learning, game theory, and computer vision. In thispaper, we provide an overarching perspective highlighting how the combinationof these fields, in particular, forms a unique microcosm for AI research, whileoffering mutual benefits for professional teams, spectators, and broadcastersin the years to come. We illustrate that this duality makes football analyticsa game changer of tremendous value, in terms of not only changing the game offootball itself, but also in terms of what this domain can mean for the fieldof AI. We review the state-of-the-art and exemplify the types of analysisenabled by combining the aforementioned fields, including illustrative examplesof counterfactual analysis using predictive models, and the combination ofgame-theoretic analysis of penalty kicks with statistical learning of playerattributes. We conclude by highlighting envisioned downstream impacts,including possibilities for extensions to other sports (real and virtual).

Then, eachaverage formation is further divided into more specific patterns in which theconfigurations of players are slightly different. The latter step is based onhierarchical clustering and the Delaunay method, which defines the formation ofa team as an adjacency matrix of Delaunay triangulation. A formation clusteredusing our method is expressed in a form such as `442-C1'.

Our modelling framework enables inference related tocauses of momentum shifts and team tactics, which is of much interest tomanagers, bookmakers, and sports fans."

Casbeer, Meir Pachter;2020/06/05;http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03682v1;This paper considers the blocking or football pursuit-evasion differentialgame. Two pursuers cooperate and try to capture the ball carrying evader as faras possible from the goal line. The evader wishes to be as close as possible tothe goal line at the time of capture and, if possible, reach the line. In thispaper the solution of the game of kind is provided: The Barrier surface thatpartitions the state space into two winning sets, one for the pursuer team andone for the evader, is constructed. Under optimal play, the winning team isdetermined by evaluating the associated Barrier function.

More recently, the organization of footballteams and their performance have been unveiled using metrics coming fromNetwork Science, where a team is considered as a complex network whose nodes(i.e., players) interact with the aim of overcoming the opponent network. Here,we combine the use of different network metrics to extract the particularsignature of the F.C. Barcelona coached by Guardiola, which has been consideredone of the best teams along football history. We have first compared thenetwork organization of Guardiola's team with their opponents along one seasonof the Spanish national league, identifying those metrics with statisticallysignificant differences and relating them with the Guardiola's game. Next, wehave focused on the temporal nature of football passing networks and calculatedthe evolution of all network properties along a match, instead of consideringtheir average. In this way, we are able to identify those network metrics thatenhance the probability of scoring/receiving a goal, showing that not all teamsbehave in the same way and how the organization Guardiola's F.C. Barcelona isdifferent from the rest, including its clustering coefficient, shortest-pathlength, largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix, algebraic connectivity andcentrality distribution.
ArXiv;Bigger data, better questions, and a return to fourth down behavior: an  introduction to a special issue on tracking data in the National football  League;Michael J. Lopez;2019/09/23;http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10631v3;Most historical National Football League (NFL) analysis, both mainstream andacademic, has relied on public, play-level data to generate team and playercomparisons. Given the number of oft omitted variables that impact on-fieldresults, such as play call, game situation, and opponent strength, findingstend to be more anecdotal than actionable. With the release of player trackingdata, however, analysts can better ask and answer questions to isolate skilland strategy. In this article, we highlight the limitations of traditionalanalyses, and use a decades-old punching bag for analysts, fourth-downstrategy, as a microcosm for why tracking data is needed. Specifically, weassert that, in absence of using the precise yardage needed for a first down,past findings supporting an aggressive fourth down strategy may have beenoverstated. Next, we synthesize recent work that comprises this special Journalof Quantitative Analysis in Sports issue into player tracking data in football.Finally, we conclude with some best practices and limitations regarding usageof this data. The release of player tracking data marks a transition for theleague and its' analysts, and we hope this issue helps guide innovation infootball analytics for years to come.

However, the field division approach isoversimplified because all locations within a region are regarded as uniformherein. The objective of the current study is to propose a fundamentalframework for space evaluation based on field weighting. In particular, weemployed the motion model and calculated a minimum arrival time $ \tau $ foreach player to all locations on the football field. Our main contribution isthat two variables $ \tau_{\textrm{of}} $ and $ \tau_{\textrm{df}} $corresponding to the minimum arrival time for offense and defense teams areconsidered; using $ \tau_{\textrm{of}} $ and $ \tau_{\textrm{df}} $, neworthogonal variables $ z_{1} $ and $ z_{2} $ are defined. In particular, basedon real datasets comprising of data from 45 football games of the J1 League in2018, we provide a detailed characterization of $ z_{1} $ and $ z_{2} $ interms of ball passing. By using our method, we found that $ z_{1}(\vec{x}, t) $and $ z_{2}(\vec{x}, t) $ represent the degree of safety for a pass made to $\vec{x} $ at $ t $ and degree of sparsity of $ \vec{x} $ at $ t $,respectively; the success probability of passes could be well-fitted using asigmoid function. Moreover, a new type of field division approach andevaluation of ball passing just before shoots using real game data arediscussed."

However, current DRLsystems still suffer from challenges of multi-agent coordination, sparserewards, stochastic environments, etc. In seeking to address these challenges,we employ a football video game, e.g., Google Research Football (GRF), as ourtestbed and develop an end-to-end learning-based AI system (denoted as TiKick)to complete this challenging task. In this work, we first generated a largereplay dataset from the self-playing of single-agent experts, which areobtained from league training. We then developed a distributed learning systemand new offline algorithms to learn a powerful multi-agent AI from the fixedsingle-agent dataset. To the best of our knowledge, Tikick is the firstlearning-based AI system that can take over the multi-agent Google ResearchFootball full game, while previous work could either control a single agent orexperiment on toy academic scenarios. Extensive experiments further show thatour pre-trained model can accelerate the training process of the modernmulti-agent algorithm and our method achieves state-of-the-art performances onvarious academic scenarios.
ArXiv;A Validation Procedure for the Estimation of Reachable Regions in  Football;M. Renkin, J. Bischofberger, E. Schikuta, A. Baca;2022/04/07;http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13992v1;Modelling the trajectorial motion of humans along the ground is afoundational task in the quantitative analysis of sports like associationfootball. Most existing models of football player motion have not beenvalidated yet with respect to actual data. One of the reasons for this lack isthat performing such a validation is not straightforward, because models ofplayer motion are usually phrased in a way that emphasises possibly reachablepositions rather than expected positions. Since positional data of footballplayers typically contains outliers, this data may misrepresent the range ofactually reachable positions.  This paper proposes a validation routine for trajectorial motion models thatmeasures and optimises the ability of a motion model to accurately predict allpossibly reachable positions by favoring the smallest predicted area ofreachable positions that encompasses all observed reached positions up to amanually defined threshold. We demonstrate validation and optimisation on fourdifferent motion models, assuming (a) motion with constant speed, (b) motionwith constant acceleration, (c) motion with constant acceleration with a speedlimit, and (d) motion along two segments with constant speed. Our results showthat assuming motion with constant speed or constant acceleration without alimit on the achievable speed is particularly inappropriate for an accuratedistinction between reachable and unreachable locations. Motion along twosegments of constant speed provides by far the highest accuracy among thetested models and serves as an efficient and accurate approximation ofreal-world player motion.

Previous studies considered a player's styleas a combination of technical performances, failing to consider the spatialinformation. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the playing styles ofeach playing position in the Chinese Football Super League (CSL) matches,integrating a recently adopted Player Vectors framework. Data of 960 matchesfrom 2016-2019 CSL were used. Match ratings, and ten types of match events withthe corresponding coordinates for all the lineup players whose on-pitch timeexceeded 45 minutes were extracted. Players were first clustered into 8positions. A player vector was constructed for each player in each match basedon the Player Vectors using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF). Another NMFprocess was run on the player vectors to extract different types of playingstyles. The resulting player vectors discovered 18 different playing styles inthe CSL. Six performance indicators of each style were investigated to observetheir contributions. In general, the playing styles of forwards and midfieldersare in line with football performance evolution trends, while the styles ofdefenders should be reconsidered. Multifunctional playing styles were alsofound in high rated CSL players.
ArXiv;Identifying and Extracting Football Features from Real-World Media  Sources using Only Synthetic Training Data;Jose Cerqueira Fernandes, Benjamin Kenwright;2022/09/27;http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13254v1;Real-world images used for training machine learning algorithms are oftenunstructured and inconsistent. The process of analysing and tagging theseimages can be costly and error prone (also availability, gaps and legalconundrums). However, as we demonstrate in this article, the potential togenerate accurate graphical images that are indistinguishable from real-worldsources has a multitude of benefits in machine learning paradigms. One suchexample of this is football data from broadcast services (television and otherstreaming media sources). The football games are usually recorded from multiplesources (cameras and phones) and resolutions, not to mention, occlusion ofvisual details and other artefacts (like blurring, weathering and lightingconditions) which make it difficult to accurately identify features. Wedemonstrate an approach which is able to overcome these limitations usinggenerated tagged and structured images. The generated images are able tosimulate a variety views and conditions (including noise and blurring) whichmay only occur sporadically in real-world data and make it difficult formachine learning algorithm to 'cope' with these unforeseen problems inreal-data. This approach enables us to rapidly train and prepare a robustsolution that accurately extracts features (e.g., spacial locations, markers onthe pitch, player positions, ball location and camera FOV) from real-worldfootball match sources for analytical purposes.

Football clubs invest millions of dollars on lineups and knowing howindividual statistics translate to better outcomes can optimise investments.Moreover, sports betting is growing exponentially and being able to predict thefuture is profitable and desirable. We use machine learning models andhistorical player data from English Premier League (2020-2022) to predictscores and to understand how individual performance can improve the outcome ofa match. We compared different prediction techniques to maximise thepossibility of finding useful models. We created heuristic and machine learningmodels predicting football scores to compare different techniques. We useddifferent sets of features and shown goalkeepers stats are more important thanattackers stats to predict goals scored. We applied a broad evaluation processto assess the efficacy of the models in real world applications. We managed topredict correctly all relegated teams after forecast 100 consecutive matches.We show that Support Vector Regression outperformed other techniques predictingfinal scores and that lineups do improve predictions. Finally, our model wasprofitable (42% return) when emulating a betting system using real world oddsdata.
ArXiv;A network-based ranking system for American college football;Juyong Park, M. E. J. Newman;2005/05/24;http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0505169v4;American college football faces a conflict created by the desire to stagenational championship games between the best teams of a season when there is noconventional playoff system to decide which those teams are. Instead, rankingof teams is based on their record of wins and losses during the season, buteach team plays only a small fraction of eligible opponents, making the systemunderdetermined or contradictory or both. It is an interesting challenge tocreate a ranking system that at once is mathematically well-founded, givesresults in general accord with received wisdom concerning the relativestrengths of the teams, and is based upon intuitive principles, allowing it tobe accepted readily by fans and experts alike. Here we introduce aone-parameter ranking method that satisfies all of these requirements and isbased on a network representation of college football schedules.
ArXiv;Self-affirmation model for football goal distributions;Elmar Bittner, Andreas Nussbaumer, Wolfhard Janke, Martin Weigel;2007/05/18;http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.2724v1;Analyzing football score data with statistical techniques, we investigate howthe highly co-operative nature of the game is reflected in averaged propertiessuch as the distributions of scored goals for the home and away teams. It turnsout that in particular the tails of the distributions are not well described byindependent Bernoulli trials, but rather well modeled by negative binomial orgeneralized extreme value distributions. To understand this behavior from firstprinciples, we suggest to modify the Bernoulli random process to include asimple component of self-affirmation which seems to describe the datasurprisingly well and allows to interpret the observed deviation from Gaussianstatistics. The phenomenological distributions used before can be understood asspecial cases within this framework. We analyzed historical football score datafrom many leagues in Europe as well as from international tournaments and foundthe proposed models to be applicable rather universally. In particular, here wecompare men's and women's leagues and the separate German leagues during thecold war times and find some remarkable differences.

ArXiv;Automated Top View Registration of Broadcast Football Videos;Rahul Anand Sharma, Bharath Bhat, Vineet Gandhi, C. V. Jawahar;2017/03/04;http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01437v1;In this paper, we propose a novel method to register football broadcast videoframes on the static top view model of the playing surface. The proposed methodis fully automatic in contrast to the current state of the art which requiresmanual initialization of point correspondences between the image and the staticmodel. Automatic registration using existing approaches has been difficult dueto the lack of sufficient point correspondences. We investigate an alternateapproach exploiting the edge information from the line markings on the field.We formulate the registration problem as a nearest neighbour search over asynthetically generated dictionary of edge map and homography pairs. Thesynthetic dictionary generation allows us to exhaustively cover a wide varietyof camera angles and positions and reduce this problem to a minimal per-frameedge map matching procedure. We show that the per-frame results can be improvedin videos using an optimization framework for temporal camera stabilization. Wedemonstrate the efficacy of our approach by presenting extensive results on adataset collected from matches of football World Cup 2014.

Alcohol consumption often comes along with social events asit helps people to increase their sociability and to overcome theirinhibitions. On the other hand we know that increased alcohol consumption canlead to serious health issues, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases anddiseases of the digestive system, to mention a few. This work examines alcoholconsumption during the FIFA Football World Cup 2018, particularly the usage ofalcohol related information on Twitter. For this we analyse the tweetingbehaviour and show that the tournament strongly increases the interest in beer.Furthermore we show that countries who had to leave the tournament at earlystage might have done something good to their fans as the interest in beerdecreased again.

ArXiv;MORE: Merged Opinions Reputation Model;Nardine Osman, Alessandro Provetti, Valerio Riggi, Carles Sierra;2015/03/31;http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.09066v1;Reputation is generally defined as the opinion of a group on an aspect of athing. This paper presents a reputation model that follows a probabilisticmodelling of opinions based on three main concepts: (1) the value of an opiniondecays with time, (2) the reputation of the opinion source impacts thereliability of the opinion, and (3) the certainty of the opinion impacts itsweight with respect to other opinions. Furthermore, the model is flexible withits opinion sources: it may use explicit opinions or implicit opinions that canbe extracted from agent behavior in domains where explicit opinions are sparse.We illustrate the latter with an approach to extract opinions from behavioralinformation in the sports domain, focusing on football in particular. One ofthe uses of a reputation model is predicting behavior. We take up the challengeof predicting the behavior of football teams in football matches, which weargue is a very interesting yet difficult approach for evaluating the model.

However, the quantification of competitive balance is notan easy task. The difficulties are mainly associated with itsmulti-dimensionality character as well as the structure of each particularsport. This article uses data from eight domestic leagues over 60 years toidentify the best index for a holistic view of competitive balance in Europeanfootball. The findings support the longstanding Uncertainty of OutcomeHypothesis using indices designed for the important three identified levels ofcompetition and offering a weighting pattern for ranking places. Importantconclusions may be derived concerning the relative importance of differentaspects of competitive balance depending on the specific features of the bestindex.

Themethod is implemented in the R add-on package GJRM and allows for modellinglinear and non-linear dependence through the use of several copulae. Moreover,the parameters of the marginal distributions of the count responses and of thecopula can be specified as flexible functions of covariates. Motivated by afootball application, we also discuss an extension which forces the regressioncoefficients of the marginal (linear) predictors to be equal via a suitablepenalisation. Model fitting is based on a trust region algorithm whichestimates simultaneously all the parameters of the joint models. We investigatethe proposal's empirical performance in two simulation studies, the first onedesigned for arbitrary count data, the other one reflecting football-specificsettings. Finally, the method is applied to FIFA World Cup data, showing itscompetitiveness to the standard approach with regard to predictive performance.

Ramchurn;2020/03/23;http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10294v1;In this paper we present a novel approach to optimise tactical and strategicdecision making in football (soccer). We model the game of football as amulti-stage game which is made up from a Bayesian game to model the pre-matchdecisions and a stochastic game to model the in-match state transitions anddecisions. Using this formulation, we propose a method to predict theprobability of game outcomes and the payoffs of team actions. Building uponthis, we develop algorithms to optimise team formation and in-game tactics withdifferent objectives. Empirical evaluation of our approach on real-worlddatasets from 760 matches shows that by using optimised tactics from ourBayesian and stochastic games, we can increase a team chances of winning by upto 16.1\% and 3.4\% respectively.

Specifically, we areconcerned about the re-start of the Spanish national football league, La Liga,which is currently -May 2020- stopped with 11 fixtures remaining. Our modelincludes two additional states of an individual, confined and quarantined,which are reached when an individual presents COVID-19 symptoms or hasundergone a virus test with a positive result. The model also accounts for theinteraction dynamics of players, considering three different sources ofinfection: the player social circle, the contact with his/her team colleaguesduring training sessions, and the interaction with rivals during a match. Ourresults highlight the influence of the days between matches, the frequency ofvirus tests and their sensitivity on the number of players infected at the endof the season. Following our findings, we finally present a variety ofstrategies to minimize the probability that COVID-19 propagates in case theseason of La Liga was re-started after the current lockdown.

ArXiv;Learning Football Body-Orientation as a Matter of Classification;Adrià Arbués-Sangüesa, Adrián Martín, Paulino Granero, Coloma Ballester, Gloria Haro;2021/06/01;http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00359v1;"Orientation is a crucial skill for football players that becomes adifferential factor in a large set of events, especially the ones involvingpasses. However, existing orientation estimation methods, which are based oncomputer-vision techniques, still have a lot of room for improvement. To thebest of our knowledge, this article presents the first deep learning model forestimating orientation directly from video footage. By approaching thischallenge as a classification problem where classes correspond to orientationbins, and by introducing a cyclic loss function, a well-known convolutionalnetwork is refined to provide player orientation data. The model is trained byusing ground-truth orientation data obtained from wearable EPTS devices, whichare individually compensated with respect to the perceived orientation in thecurrent frame. The obtained results outperform previous methods; in particular,the absolute median error is less than 12 degrees per player. An ablation studyis included in order to show the potential generalization to any kind offootball video footage."
ArXiv;What Happened Next? Using Deep Learning to Value Defensive Actions in  Football Event-Data;Charbel Merhej, Ryan Beal, Sarvapali Ramchurn, Tim Matthews;2021/06/03;http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01786v1;Objectively quantifying the value of player actions in football (soccer) is achallenging problem. To date, studies in football analytics have mainly focusedon the attacking side of the game, while there has been less work onevent-driven metrics for valuing defensive actions (e.g., tackles andinterceptions). Therefore in this paper, we use deep learning techniques todefine a novel metric that values such defensive actions by studying the threatof passages of play that preceded them. By doing so, we are able to valuedefensive actions based on what they prevented from happening in the game. OurDefensive Action Expected Threat (DAxT) model has been validated usingreal-world event-data from the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 English Premier Leagueseasons, and we combine our model outputs with additional features to derive anoverall rating of defensive ability for players. Overall, we find that ourmodel is able to predict the impact of defensive actions allowing us to bettervalue defenders using event-data.
ArXiv;Effect of Key Match Events on Football Passmaps;Vid Stropnik, Vuk Đuranović, Maruša Oražem;2021/08/11;http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05343v1;A team of association football players may be envisioned as a directednetwork with player nodes and weighted pass edges. Such a simplisticrepresentation of an otherwise complex structure yields several benefits, butalso permits the application of well-established network analysis approaches,to gain insights into the match flow. The authors of this work propose theapplication of these, including centrality measures, community detectionmethods, and the analysis of induced subgraphs, to analyze the potentialeffects certain match events have on the team. In addition to reporting ontheir findings, they emphasize their work's contribution of over 9000 novelfootball network representations to the Network Analysis community.
ArXiv;Analyzing the Behavior of Soccer Fans from a Mobile Phone Network  Perspective: Euro 2016, a Case Study;Gergő Pintér, Imre Felde;2021/08/17;http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09291v1;In this study, we analyzed one month of Call Detail Records, coveringBudapest in June, 2016. During this observation period, the 2016 UEFA EuropeanFootball Championship took place, where the Hungarian national football teamdid well, beyond expectations. This case study focuses on the fans' behavior inBudapest, during and after the Hungarian matches, from the perspective of themobile phone network data. Tense rooting, joy of scoring a goal,self-forgetting celebration because of winning the group. All of these have aneffect on the data, that can be simply revealed. We used descriptivestatistical methods to analyze the available data set, and managed todemonstrate the potential of this kind of data at social sensing. We found thatthe mobile phone network activity reflects the football fans' behavior, even ifthe match is played in another country.
ArXiv;Clustering of football players based on performance data and aggregated  clustering validity indexes;Serhat Akhanli, Christian Hennig;2022/04/20;http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09793v1;We analyse football (soccer) player performance data with mixed typevariables from the 2014-15 season of eight European major leagues. We clusterthese data based on a tailor-made dissimilarity measure.  In order to decide between the many available clustering methods and tochoose an appropriate number of clusters, we use the approach by Akhanli andHennig (2020). This is based on several validation criteria that refer todifferent desirable characteristics of a clustering. These characteristics arechosen based on the aim of clustering, and this allows to define a suitablevalidation index as weighted average of calibrated individual indexes measuringthe desirable features.  We derive two different clusterings. The first one is a partition of the dataset into major groups of essentially different players, which can be used forthe analysis of a team's composition. The second one divides the data set intomany small clusters (with 10 players on average), which can be used for findingplayers with a very similar profile to a given player. It is discussed in depthwhat characteristics are desirable for these clusterings. Weighting thecriteria for the second clustering is informed by a survey of football experts.
ArXiv;The Second-Order Football-Pool Problem and the Optimal Rate of  Generalized-Covering Codes;Dor Elimelech, Moshe Schwartz;2022/10/02;http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00531v1;The goal of the classic football-pool problem is to determine how manylottery tickets are to be bought in order to guarantee at least $n-r$ correctguesses out of a sequence of $n$ games played. We study a generalized(second-order) version of this problem, in which any of these $n$ gamesconsists of two sub-games. The second-order version of the football-poolproblem is formulated using the notion of generalized-covering radius, recentlyproposed as a fundamental property of linear codes. We consider an extension ofthis property to general (not necessarily linear) codes, and provide anasymptotic solution to our problem by finding the optimal rate function ofsecond-order covering codes given a fixed normalized covering radius. We alsoprove that the fraction of second-order covering codes among codes ofsufficiently large rate tends to $1$ as the code length tends to $\infty$.

Both of these properties can lead to spurious cues to beexploited by models rather than learning to ground language. In this paper, wepresent GrOunded footbAlL commentaries (GOAL), a novel dataset of football (or`soccer') highlights videos with transcribed live commentaries in English. Asthe course of a game is unpredictable, so are commentaries, which makes them aunique resource to investigate dynamic language grounding. We also providestate-of-the-art baselines for the following tasks: frame reordering, momentretrieval, live commentary retrieval and play-by-play live commentarygeneration. Results show that SOTA models perform reasonably well in mosttasks. We discuss the implications of these results and suggest new tasks forwhich GOAL can be used.

ArXiv;Location analysis of players in UEFA EURO 2020 and 2022 using  generalized valuation of defense by estimating probabilities;Rikuhei Umemoto, Kazushi Tsutsui, Keisuke Fujii;2022/11/30;http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00021v1;Analyzing defenses in team sports is generally challenging because of thelimited event data. Researchers have previously proposed methods to evaluatefootball team defense by predicting the events of ball gain and being attackedusing locations of all players and the ball. However, they did not consider theimportance of the events, assumed the perfect observation of all 22 players,and did not fully investigated the influence of the diversity (e.g.,nationality and sex). Here, we propose a generalized valuation method ofdefensive teams by score-scaling the predicted probabilities of the events.Using the open-source location data of all players in broadcast video frames infootball games of men's Euro 2020 and women's Euro 2022, we investigated theeffect of the number of players on the prediction and validated our approach byanalyzing the games. Results show that for the predictions of being attacked,scoring, and conceding, all players' information was not necessary, while thatof ball gain required information on three to four offensive and defensiveplayers. With game analyses we explained the excellence in defense of finalistteams in Euro 2020. Our approach might be applicable to location data frombroadcast video frames in football games.

Rabinowitz, John Whyte, Carol L. Roan, Andrew Tabatabaei, Michael Baiocchi, Jason H. Karlawish, Christina L. Master, Dylan S. Small;2016/07/06;http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01756v1;A potential causal relationship between head injuries sustained by NFLplayers and later-life neurological decline may have broad implications forparticipants in youth and high school football programs. However, brain traumarisk at the professional level may be different than that at the youth and highschool levels and the long-term effects of participation at these levels isas-yet unclear. To investigate the effect of playing high school football onlater life depression and cognitive functioning, we propose a retrospectiveobservational study using data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) ofgraduates from Wisconsin high schools in 1957.  We compare 1,153 high school males who played varsity football to 2,751 malestudents who did not. 1,951 of the control subjects did not play any sport andthe remaining 800 controls played a non-contact sport. We focus on two primaryoutcomes measured at age 65: a composite cognitive outcome measuring verbalfluency and memory and the modified CES-D depression score. To control forpotential confounders we adjust for pre-exposure covariates such as IQ withmatching and model-based covariate adjustment. We will conduct an orderedtesting procedure that uses all 2,751 controls while controlling for possibleunmeasured differences between students who played sports and those who didnot. We will quantitatively assess the sensitivity of the results to potentialunmeasured confounding. The study will also consider several secondary outcomesof clinical interest such as aggression and heavy drinking. The rich set ofpre-exposure variables, relatively unbiased sampling, and longitudinal natureof the WLS dataset make the proposed analysis unique among related studies thatrely primarily on convenience samples of football players with reportedneurological symptoms.
ArXiv;Large Scale Diverse Combinatorial Optimization: ESPN Fantasy Football  Player Trades;Aaron Baughman, Daniel Bohm, Micah Forster, Eduardo Morales, Jeff Powell, Shaun McPartlin, Raja Hebbar, Kavitha Yogaraj, Yoshika Chhabra, Sudeep Ghosh, Rukhsan Ul Haq, Arjun Kashyap;2021/11/04;http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02859v3;Even skilled fantasy football managers can be disappointed by theirmid-season rosters as some players inevitably fall short of draft dayexpectations. Team managers can quickly discover that their team has a lowscore ceiling even if they start their best active players. A novel and diversecombinatorial optimization system proposes high volume and unique player tradesbetween complementary teams to balance trade fairness. Several algorithmscreate the valuation of each fantasy football player with an ensemble ofcomputing models: Quantum Support Vector Classifier with Permutation Importance(QSVC-PI), Quantum Support Vector Classifier with Accumulated Local Effects(QSVC-ALE), Variational Quantum Circuit with Permutation Importance (VQC-PI),Hybrid Quantum Neural Network with Permutation Importance (HQNN-PI), eXtremeGradient Boosting Classifier (XGB), and Subject Matter Expert (SME) rules. Thevaluation of each player is personalized based on league rules, roster, andselections. The cost of trading away a player is related to a team's roster,such as the depth at a position, slot count, and position importance. Teams arepaired together for trading based on a cosine dissimilarity score so that teamscan offset their strengths and weaknesses. A knapsack 0-1 algorithm computesoutgoing players for each team. Postprocessors apply analytics and deeplearning models to measure 6 different objective measures about each trade.Over the 2020 and 2021 National Football League (NFL) seasons, a group of 24experts from IBM and ESPN evaluated trade quality through 10 Football ErrorAnalysis Tool (FEAT) sessions. Our system started with 76.9% of high-qualitytrades and was deployed for the 2021 season with 97.3% of high-quality trades.To increase trade quantity, our quantum, classical, and rules-based computinghave 100% trade uniqueness. We use Qiskit's quantum simulators throughout ourwork.

Interestingly,while the ultimate goal of identifying the best teams is the same, the numberof regular season games played differs dramatically between the sports, rangingfrom 16 (football) to 82 (basketball and hockey) to 162 (baseball). Thoughlength of season is partially determined by many factors including travellogistics, rest requirements, playoff structure and television contracts, it ishard to reconcile the 10-fold difference in the number of games between, forexample, the NFL and MLB unless football games are somehow more ""informative""than baseball games. In this paper, we aim to quantify the amount ofinformation games yield about the relative strength of the teams involved. Ourstrategy is to assess how well simple paired comparison models fitted from $X%$of the games within a season predict the outcomes of the remaining $(100-X)%$of games, for multiple values of $X$. We compare the resulting predictiveaccuracy curves between seasons within the same sport and across all foursports, and find dramatic differences in the amount of information yielded byindividual game results in the four major U.S. sports."

Morris;2017/06/14;http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04336v1;To investigate whether training load monitoring data could be used to predictinjuries in elite Australian football players, data were collected from eliteathletes over 3 seasons at an Australian football club. Loads were quantifiedusing GPS devices, accelerometers and player perceived exertion ratings.Absolute and relative training load metrics were calculated for each playereach day (rolling average, exponentially weighted moving average, acute:chronicworkload ratio, monotony and strain). Injury prediction models (regularisedlogistic regression, generalised estimating equations, random forests andsupport vector machines) were built for non-contact, non-contact time-loss andhamstring specific injuries using the first two seasons of data. Injurypredictions were generated for the third season and evaluated using the areaunder the receiver operator characteristic (AUC). Predictive performance wasonly marginally better than chance for models of non-contact and non-contacttime-loss injuries (AUC$<$0.65). The best performing model was a multivariatelogistic regression for hamstring injuries (best AUC=0.76). Learning curvessuggested logistic regression was underfitting the load-injury relationship andthat using a more complex model or increasing the amount of model building datamay lead to future improvements. Injury prediction models built using trainingload data from a single club showed poor ability to predict injuries whentested on previously unseen data, suggesting they are limited as a dailydecision tool for practitioners. Focusing the modelling approach on specificinjury types and increasing the amount of training data may lead to thedevelopment of improved predictive models for injury prevention.
ArXiv;Robust analysis of second-leg home advantage in UEFA football through  better nonparametric confidence intervals for binary regression functions;Gery Geenens, Thomas Cuddihy;2017/01/26;http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07555v1;In international football (soccer), two-legged knockout ties, with each teamplaying at home in one leg and the final outcome decided on aggregate, arecommon. Many players, managers and followers seem to believe in the `second-leghome advantage', i.e. that it is beneficial to play at home on the second leg.A more complex effect than the usual and well-established home advantage, it isharder to identify, and previous statistical studies did not prove conclusiveabout its actuality. Yet, given the amount of money handled in internationalfootball competitions nowadays, the question of existence or otherwise of thiseffect is of real import. As opposed to previous research, this paper addressesit from a purely nonparametric perspective and brings a very objective answer,not based on any particular model specification which could orientate theanalysis in one or the other direction. Along the way, the paper reviews thewell-known shortcomings of the Wald confidence interval for a proportion,suggests new nonparametric confidence intervals for conditional probabilityfunctions, revisits the problem of the bias when building confidence intervalsin nonparametric regression, and provides a novel bootstrap-based solution toit. Finally, the new intervals are used in a careful analysis of game outcomedata for the UEFA Champions and Europa leagues from 2009/10 to 2014/15. Aslight `second-leg home advantage' is evidenced.
ArXiv;Passive Cervical Spine Ligaments Provide Stability during Head Impacts  in Vivo;Calvin Kuo, Jodie Sheffels, Michael Fanton, Ina Bianca Yu, Rosa Hamalainen, David Camarillo;2019/04/02;http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03102v1;It has long been suggested that neck muscle strength and anticipatorycocontraction can decrease head motions during head impacts. Here, we quantifythe relative angular impulse contributions of neck soft tissue to headstabilization using a musculoskeletal model with Hill-type muscles andrate-dependent ligaments. We simulated sagittal extension and lateral flexionmild experimental head impacts performed on 10 subjects with relaxed orcocontracted muscles, and median American football head impacts. We estimatedangular impulses from active muscle, passive muscle, and ligaments during headimpact acceleration and deceleration phases. During the acceleration phase,active musculature produced resistive angular impulses that were 30% of theimpact angular impulse in experimental impacts with cocontracted muscles. Thiswas reduced below 20% in football impacts. During the deceleration phase,active musculature stabilized the head with 50% of the impact angular impulsein experimental impacts with cocontracted muscles. However, passive ligamentsprovided greater stabilizing angular impulses in football impacts. Theredistribution of stabilizing angular impulses results from ligament and muscledependence on lengthening rate, where ligaments stiffen substantially comparedto active muscle at high lengthening rates. Thus, ligaments provide relativelygreater deceleration impulses in these impacts, which limits the effectivenessof muscle strengthening or anticipated activations.

ArXiv;Evaluating probabilistic forecasts of football matches: The case against  the Ranked Probability Score;Edward Wheatcroft;2019/08/23;http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08980v1;A scoring rule is a function of a probabilistic forecast and a correspondingoutcome that is used to evaluate forecast performance. A wide range of scoringrules have been defined over time and there is some debate as to which are themost appropriate for evaluating the performance of forecasts of sportingevents. This paper focuses on forecasts of the outcomes of football matches.The ranked probability score (RPS) is often recommended since it is `sensitiveto distance', that is it takes into account the ordering in the outcomes (ahome win is `closer' to a draw than it is to an away win, for example). In thispaper, this reasoning is disputed on the basis that it adds nothing in terms ofthe actual aims of using scoring rules. A related property of scoring rules islocality. A scoring rule is local if it only takes the probability placed onthe outcome into consideration. Two simulation experiments are carried out inthe context of football matches to compare the performance of the RPS, which isnon-local and sensitive to distance, the Brier score, which is non-local andinsensitive to distance, and the ignorance score, which is local andinsensitive to distance. The ignorance score is found to outperform both theRPS and the Brier score, casting doubt on the value of non-locality andsensitivity to distance as properties of scoring rules in this context.
ArXiv;Does 4-4-2 exist? -- An Analytics Approach to Understand and Classify  Football Team Formations in Single Match Situations;Eric Müller-Budack, Jonas Theiner, Robert Rein, Ralph Ewerth;2019/09/02;http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00412v1;The chances to win a football match can be significantly increased if theright tactic is chosen and the behavior of the opposite team is wellanticipated. For this reason, every professional football club employs a teamof game analysts. However, at present game performance analysis is donemanually and therefore highly time-consuming. Consequently, automated tools tosupport the analysis process are required. In this context, one of the maintasks is to summarize team formations by patterns such as 4-4-2. In this paper,we introduce an analytics approach that automatically classifies and visualizesthe team formation based on the players' position data. We focus on singlematch situations instead of complete halftimes or matches to provide a moredetailed analysis. A detailed analysis of individual match situations dependingon ball possession and match segment length is provided. For this purpose, avisual summary is utilized that summarizes the team formation in a matchsegment. An expert annotation study is conducted that demonstrates 1) thecomplexity of the task and 2) the usefulness of the visualization of singlesituations to understand team formations. The suggested classification approachoutperforms existing methods for formation classification. In particular, ourapproach gives insights about the shortcomings of using patterns like 4-4-2 todescribe team formations.
ArXiv;Prevention of Traumatic Brain Injury with Liquid Shock Absorption;Hossein Vahid Alizadeh, Michael G. Fanton, August G. Domel, Gerald Grant, David Benjamin Camarillo;2019/10/17;http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07722v1;The discovery that repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) can resultin chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in high risk contact sports has ledto increased scrutiny of head protective gear. In this work, we asked if it wasphysically possible to prevent mTBI in American football with helmets alone.Here, we show that modern helmets of several types are unlikely to prevent mTBIfrom high speed collisions as might be seen in the NFL, but that introducingliquid as an energy absorbing medium can dramatically reduce the forces ofimpact across a spectrum of impact severities. We hypothesized that a helmetwhich transmits a nearly constant force during football impacts is sufficientto reduce biomechanical loading in the brain below the threshold of mTBI. Totest this hypothesis, we first show that the optimal impact force transmittedto the head, in terms of brain strain, is in fact a constant force profile.Then, to generate a constant force with a helmet, we implement a computationalmodel of a fluid-based shock absorber that adapts passively to any given impactspeed. Computer simulation of head impacts with liquid shock absorptionindicate that, at the highest impact speed, the average brain tissue strain isreduced by 27.6% $\pm$ 9.3 compared to existing helmet padding that isavailable on the market. These simulations are based on the NFL's helmet testprotocol and predict that adding liquid shock absorbers could reduce the numberof concussions by at least 75%. Taken together, these results suggest that themajority of mTBI in football could be prevented with more efficient helmettechnology.
ArXiv;Robustness of football passing networks against continuous node and link  removals;Genki Ichinose, Tomohiro Tsuchiya, Shunsuke Watanabe;2020/03/27;http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13465v2;We can construct passing networks when we regard a player as a node and apass as a link in football games. Thus, we can analyze the networks by usingtools developed in network science. Among various metrics characterizing anetwork, centrality metrics have often been used to identify key players in apassing network. However, a tolerance to players being marked or passes beingblocked in a passing network, namely the robustness of the network, has beenpoorly understood so far. Because the robustness of a passing network can beconnected to the increase of ball possession, it would be deeply related to theoutcome of a game. Here, we developed position-dependent passing networks of 45matches by 18 teams belonging to the Japan Professional Football League. Then,nodes or links were continuously removed from the passing networks by tworemoval methods so that we could evaluate the robustness of these networksagainst the removals. The results show that these passing networks commonlycontain hubs (key players making passes). Then, we analyzed the most robustnetworks in detail and found that their full backs increase the robustness byoften invoking a heavier emphasis on attack. Moreover, we showed that therobustness of the passing networks and the team performance have a positivecorrelation.

Camarillo;2020/08/05;http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01903v2;Because of the relatively rigid coupling between the upper dentition and theskull, instrumented mouthguards have been shown to be a viable way of measuringhead impact kinematics for assisting in understanding the underlyingbiomechanics of concussions. This has led various companies and institutions tofurther develop instrumented mouthguards. However, their use as a research toolfor understanding concussive impacts makes quantification of their accuracycritical, especially given the conflicting results from various recent studies.Here we present a study that uses a pneumatic impactor to deliver impactscharacteristic to football to a Hybrid III headform, in order to validate andcompare five of the most commonly used instrumented mouthguards. We found thatall tested mouthguards gave accurate measurements for the peak angularacceleration (mean relative error, MRE < 13%), the peak angular velocity (MRE <8%), brain injury criteria values (MRE < 13%) and brain deformation (describedas maximum principal strain and fiber strain, calculated by a convolutionalneural network based brain model, MRE < 9%). Finally, we found that theaccuracy of the measurement varies with the impact locations yet is notsensitive to the impact velocity for the most part.
ArXiv;G-Elo: Generalization of the Elo algorithm by modelling the discretized  margin of victory;Leszek Szczecinski;2020/10/20;http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11187v3;"In this work we develop a new algorithm for rating of teams (or players) inone-on-one games by exploiting the observed difference of the game-points (suchas goals), also known as a margin of victory (MOV). Our objective is to obtainthe Elo-style algorithm whose operation is simple to implement and tounderstand intuitively. This is done in three steps: first, we define theprobabilistic model between the teams' skills and the discretized MOV variable:this generalizes the model underpinning the Elo algorithm, where the MOVvariable is discretized into three categories (win/loss/draw). Second, with theformal probabilistic model at hand, the optimization required by the maximumlikelihood rule is implemented via stochastic gradient; this yields simpleon-line equations for the rating updates which are identical in their generalform to those characteristic of the Elo algorithm: the main difference lies inthe way the scores and the expected scores are defined. Third, we propose asimple method to estimate the coefficients of the model, and thus define theoperation of the algorithm; it is done in a closed form using the historicaldata so the algorithm is tailored to the sport of interest and the coefficientsdefining its operation are determined in entirely transparent manner. Thealternative, optimization-based strategy to find the coefficients is alsopresented. We show numerical examples based on the results of the associationfootball of the English Premier League and the American football of theNational Football League."

Connor, Paul Muller, Ian Graham, William Spearman, Karl Tuyls;2021/06/08;http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04219v1;In multiagent environments, several decision-making individuals interactwhile adhering to the dynamics constraints imposed by the environment. Theseinteractions, combined with the potential stochasticity of the agents'decision-making processes, make such systems complex and interesting to studyfrom a dynamical perspective. Significant research has been conducted onlearning models for forward-direction estimation of agent behaviors, forexample, pedestrian predictions used for collision-avoidance in self-drivingcars. However, in many settings, only sporadic observations of agents may beavailable in a given trajectory sequence. For instance, in football, subsets ofplayers may come in and out of view of broadcast video footage, whileunobserved players continue to interact off-screen. In this paper, we study theproblem of multiagent time-series imputation, where available past and futureobservations of subsets of agents are used to estimate missing observations forother agents. Our approach, called the Graph Imputer, uses forward- andbackward-information in combination with graph networks and variationalautoencoders to enable learning of a distribution of imputed trajectories. Weevaluate our approach on a dataset of football matches, using a projectivecamera module to train and evaluate our model for the off-screen player stateestimation setting. We illustrate that our method outperforms severalstate-of-the-art approaches, including those hand-crafted for football.
ArXiv;Frame by frame completion probability of an NFL pass;Gustavo Pompeu da Silva, Rafael de Andrade Moral;2021/09/16;http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08051v1;American football is an increasingly popular sport, with a growing audiencein many countries in the world. The most watched American football league inthe world is the United States' National Football League (NFL), where everyoffensive play can be either a run or a pass, and in this work we focus onpasses. Many factors can affect the probability of pass completion, such asreceiver separation from the nearest defender, distance from receiver topasser, offense formation, among many others. When predicting the completionprobability of a pass, it is essential to know who the target of the pass is.By using distance measures between players and the ball, it is possible tocalculate empirical probabilities and predict very accurately who the targetwill be. The big question is: how likely is it for a pass to be completed in anNFL match while the ball is in the air? We developed a machine learningalgorithm to answer this based on several predictors. Using data from the 2018NFL season, we obtained conditional and marginal predictions for passcompletion probability based on a random forest model. This is based on atwo-stage procedure: first, we calculate the probability of each offensiveplayer being the pass target, then, conditional on the target, we predictcompletion probability based on the random forest model. Finally, the generalcompletion probability can be calculated using the law of total probability. Wepresent animations for selected plays and show the pass completion probabilityevolution.
ArXiv;Analyzing the Behavior and Financial Status of Soccer Fans from a Mobile  Phone Network Perspective: Euro 2016, a Case Study;Gergő Pintér, Imre Felde;2021/11/15;http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07685v1;In this study, Call Detail Records (CDRs), covering Budapest, for the monthof June in 2016 has been analyzed. During this observation period, the 2016UEFA European Football Championship took place, which affected significantlythe habit of the residents, despite the fact that not a single match was playedin the city. We evaluated the fans' behavior in Budapest, during and after theHungarian matches, and found that the mobile phone network activity reflectsthe football fans' behavior, demonstrating the potential of mobile phonenetwork data within a social sensing system. The Call Detail Records areenriched with mobile phone properties to analyze the subscribers' devices.Applying the device information (Type Allocation Code) from the activityrecords, the Subscriber Identity Modules, that do not operate in cell phonesare omitted from mobility analyses, allowing to focus on people. The mobilephone price is proposed and evaluated as a socioeconomic indicator, andcorrelation between the phone price and the mobility customs have been found.We also found that, beside the cell phone price, the subscriber age and thesubscription type also have an effect on the mobility. On the other hand, thesedo not seem to affect the interest in football.
ArXiv;A Survey on Video Action Recognition in Sports: Datasets, Methods and  Applications;Fei Wu, Qingzhong Wang, Jian Bian, Haoyi Xiong, Ning Ding, Feixiang Lu, Jun Cheng, Dejing Dou;2022/06/02;http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01038v1;To understand human behaviors, action recognition based on videos is a commonapproach. Compared with image-based action recognition, videos provide muchmore information. Reducing the ambiguity of actions and in the last decade,many works focused on datasets, novel models and learning approaches haveimproved video action recognition to a higher level. However, there arechallenges and unsolved problems, in particular in sports analytics where datacollection and labeling are more sophisticated, requiring sport professionalsto annotate data. In addition, the actions could be extremely fast and itbecomes difficult to recognize them. Moreover, in team sports like football andbasketball, one action could involve multiple players, and to correctlyrecognize them, we need to analyse all players, which is relativelycomplicated. In this paper, we present a survey on video action recognition forsports analytics. We introduce more than ten types of sports, including teamsports, such as football, basketball, volleyball, hockey and individual sports,such as figure skating, gymnastics, table tennis, tennis, diving and badminton.Then we compare numerous existing frameworks for sports analysis to presentstatus quo of video action recognition in both team sports and individualsports. Finally, we discuss the challenges and unsolved problems in this areaand to facilitate sports analytics, we develop a toolbox using PaddlePaddle,which supports football, basketball, table tennis and figure skating actionrecognition.

Thispaper describes a joint research effort with SciSports, during the Study GroupMathematics with Industry 2018 at Eindhoven, the Netherlands. The mainchallenge that we addressed was to automatically process empirical footballplayers' trajectories, in order to extract useful information from them. Thedata provided to us was two-dimensional positional data during entire matches.We developed methods based on Newtonian mechanics and the Kalman filter,Generative Adversarial Nets and Variational Autoencoders. In addition, wetrained a discriminator network to recognize and discern different movementpatterns of players. The Kalman-filter approach yields an interpretable model,in which a small number of player-dependent parameters can be fit; in theorythis could be used to distinguish among players. TheGenerative-Adversarial-Nets approach appears promising in theory, and someinitial tests showed an improvement with respect to the baseline, but thelimits in time and computational power meant that we could not fully exploreit. We also trained a Discriminator network to distinguish between two playersbased on their trajectories; after training, the network managed to distinguishbetween some pairs of players, but not between others. After training, theVariational Autoencoders generated trajectories that are difficult todistinguish, visually, from the data. These experiments provide an indicationthat deep generative models can learn the underlying structure and statisticsof football players' trajectories. This can serve as a starting point fordetermining player qualities based on such trajectory data."

ArXiv;Sidestepping the Cosmological Constant with Football-Shaped Extra  Dimensions;Sean M. Carroll, Monica M. Guica;2003/02/11;http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0302067v1;We present an exact solution for a factorizable brane-world spacetime withtwo extra dimensions and explicit brane sources. The compactification manifoldhas the topology of a two-sphere, and is stabilized by a bulk cosmologicalconstant and magnetic flux. The geometry of the sphere is locally round exceptfor conical singularities at the locations of two antipodal branes, deformingthe sphere into an American-style football. The bulk magnetic flux needs to befine-tuned to obtain flat geometry on the branes. Once this is done, the branegeometry is insensitive to the brane vacuum energy, which only affects theconical deficit angle of the extra dimensions. Solutions of this form provide anew arena in which to explore brane-world phenomenology and the effects ofextra dimensions on the cosmological constant problem.

ArXiv;U(1)_R mediation from the flux compactification in six dimensions;Hyun Min Lee;2008/07/11;http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.1858v2;We consider a supersymmetric completion of codimension-two branes withnonzero tension in a 6D gauged supergravity. As a consequence, we obtain thefootball solution with 4D Minkowski space as a new supersymmetric backgroundthat preserves 4D N=1 SUSY. In the presence of brane multiplets, we derive the4D effective supergravity action for the football background and show that theremaining modulus can be stabilized by a bulk non-perturbative correction withbrane uplifting potentials at a zero vacuum energy. We find that the U(1)_Rmediation can be a dominant source of SUSY breaking for a brane scalar withnonzero R charge.
ArXiv;A Compact Codimension Two Braneworld with Precisely One Brane;Nikolas Akerblom, Gunther Cornelissen;2010/04/11;http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.1807v3;Building on earlier work on football shaped extra dimensions, we construct acompact codimension two braneworld with precisely one brane. The two extradimensions topologically represent a 2-torus which is stabilized by a bulkcosmological constant and magnetic flux. The torus has positive constantcurvature almost everywhere, except for a single conical singularity at thelocation of the brane. In contradistinction to the football shaped case, thereis no fine-tuning required for the brane tension. We also present someplausibility arguments why the model should not suffer from serious stabilityissues.

Using passing data made available byFIFA during the 2010 World Cup, we construct for each team a weighted anddirected network in which nodes correspond to players and arrows to passes. Theresulting network or graph provides a direct visual inspection of a team'sstrategy, from which we can identify play pattern, determine hot-spots on theplay and localize potential weaknesses. Using different centrality measures, wecan also determine the relative importance of each player in the game, the`popularity' of a player, and the effect of removing players from the game.

We first describe the standard plus-minus methodology as used inbasketball and ice-hockey and then adapt it for use in soccer. The usualgoal-differential plus-minus is considered before two variations are proposed.For the first variation, we present a methodology to calculate an expectedgoals plus-minus rating. The second variation makes use of in-playprobabilities of match outcome to evaluate an expected points plus-minusrating. We use the ratings to examine who are the best players in Europeanfootball, and demonstrate how the players' ratings evolve over time. Finally,we shed light on the debate regarding which is the strongest league. The modelsuggests the English Premier League is the strongest, with the GermanBundesliga a close runner-up.
ArXiv;Synthesis of supervised classification algorithm using intelligent and  statistical tools;Ali Douik, Mourad Moussa Jlassi;2009/12/11;http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2302v1;A fundamental task in detecting foreground objects in both static and dynamicscenes is to take the best choice of color system representation and theefficient technique for background modeling. We propose in this paper anon-parametric algorithm dedicated to segment and to detect objects in colorimages issued from a football sports meeting. Indeed segmentation by pixelconcern many applications and revealed how the method is robust to detectobjects, even in presence of strong shadows and highlights. In the other handto refine their playing strategy such as in football, handball, volley ball,Rugby..., the coach need to have a maximum of technical-tactics informationabout the on-going of the game and the players. We propose in this paper arange of algorithms allowing the resolution of many problems appearing in theautomated process of team identification, where each player is affected to hiscorresponding team relying on visual data. The developed system was tested on amatch of the Tunisian national competition. This work is prominent for manynext computer vision studies as it's detailed in this study.

Especially, we find that there exists a characteristicinterpersonal distance $ r\simeq 500 $ cm below which the circular variance fortheir alignment decreases rapidly. By introducing the order parameter $ \phi(t)$ in order to measure degree of alignment of players' velocity vectors, we alsofind that the angle distribution between the nearest players' velocity vectorsbecomes wrapped Cauchy ($ \phi \lesssim 0.7 $) and the mixture of von Mises andwrapped Cauchy distributions ($ \phi \gtrsim 0.7 $), respectively. Tounderstand these findings, we construct a simple model for the motion of thetwo interacting players with the following rules: chasing between the playersand the reset of the chasing. We numerically show that our model successfullyreproduce the results obtained from the actual data. Moreover, from thenumerical study, we find that there is another characteristic distance $r\simeq 1000 $ cm below which player's chasing starts.

While tracking datasets inother sports often contain detailed annotations of on-field events, annotationsin the NFL's tracking data are limited. Methods for creating these annotationstypically require extensive human labeling, which is difficult and expensive.We begin tackling this class of problems by creating annotations for passcoverage types by defensive backs using unsupervised learning techniques, whichrequire no manual labeling or human oversight. We define a set of features fromthe NFL's tracking data that help distinguish between ""zone"" and ""man""coverage. We use Gaussian mixture modeling and hierarchical clustering tocreate clusters corresponding to each group, and we assign the appropriate typeof coverage to each cluster through qualitative analysis of the plays in eachcluster. We find that the mixture model's ""soft"" cluster assignments allow formore flexibility when identifying coverage types. Our work makes possibleseveral potential avenues of future NFL research, and we provide a basicexploration of these in this paper."
ArXiv;Fitting motion models to contextual player behavior;Bartholomew Spencer, Karl Jackson, Sam Robertson;2019/07/24;http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10762v1;The objective of this study was to incorporate contextual information intothe modelling of player movements. This was achieved by combining thedistributions of forthcoming passing contests that players committed to andthose they did not. The resultant array measures the probability a player wouldcommit to forthcoming contests in their vicinity. Commitment-based motionmodels were fit on 46220 samples of player behavior in the Australian FootballLeague. It was found that the shape of commitment-based models differed greatlyto displacement-based models for Australian footballers. Player commitmentarrays were used to measure the spatial occupancy and dominance of theattacking team. The spatial characteristics of pass receivers were extractedfor 2934 passes. Positional trends in passing were identified. Furthermore,passes were clustered into three components using Gaussian mixture models.Passes in the AFL are most commonly to one-on-one contests or unmarked players.Furthermore, passes were rarely greater than 25 m.

ArXiv;Classification of Passes in Football Matches using Spatiotemporal Data;Michael Horton, Joachim Gudmundsson, Sanjay Chawla, Joël Estephan;2014/07/18;http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.5093v1;A knowledgeable observer of a game of football (soccer) can make a subjectiveevaluation of the quality of passes made between players during the game. Weinvestigate the problem of producing an automated system to make the sameevaluation of passes. We present a model that constructs numerical predictorvariables from spatiotemporal match data using feature functions based onmethods from computational geometry, and then learns a classification functionfrom labelled examples of the predictor variables. Furthermore, the learnedclassifiers are analysed to determine if there is a relationship between thecomplexity of the algorithm that computed the predictor variable and theimportance of the variable to the classifier. Experimental results show that weare able to produce a classifier with 85.8% accuracy on classifying passes asGood, OK or Bad, and that the predictor variables computed using complexmethods from computational geometry are of moderate importance to the learnedclassifiers. Finally, we show that the inter-rater agreement on passclassification between the machine classifier and a human observer is ofsimilar magnitude to the agreement between two observers.
ArXiv;Win-stay lose-shift strategy in formation changes in football;Kohei Tamura, Naoki Masuda;2015/03/09;http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02484v2;Managerial decision making is likely to be a dominant determinant ofperformance of teams in team sports. Here we use Japanese and German footballdata to investigate correlates between temporal patterns of formation changesacross matches and match results. We found that individual teams and managersboth showed win-stay lose-shift behavior, a type of reinforcement learning. Inother words, they tended to stick to the current formation after a win andswitch to a different formation after a loss. In addition, formation changesdid not statistically improve the results of succeeding matches.The resultsindicate that a swift implementation of a new formation in the win-staylose-shift manner may not be a successful managerial rule of thumb.

Dodds;2015/06/25;http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.03886v4;Sports are spontaneous generators of stories. Through skill and chance, thescript of each game is dynamically written in real time by players acting outpossible trajectories allowed by a sport's rules. By properly characterizing agiven sport's ecology of `game stories', we are able to capture the sport'scapacity for unfolding interesting narratives, in part by contrasting them withrandom walks. Here, we explore the game story space afforded by a data set of1,310 Australian Football League (AFL) score lines. We find that AFL gamesexhibit a continuous spectrum of stories rather than distinct clusters. We showhow coarse-graining reveals identifiable motifs ranging from last minutecomeback wins to one-sided blowouts. Through an extensive comparison withbiased random walks, we show that real AFL games deliver a broader array ofmotifs than null models, and we provide consequent insights into the narrativeappeal of real games.

The Gaussian processperspective enables a) a principled way of dealing with uncertainty and b) richmodels, specified through kernel functions. Using this connection, we tacklethe problem of predicting outcomes of football matches between national teams.We develop a player kernel that relates any two football matches through theplayers lined up on the field. This makes it possible to share knowledge gainedfrom observing matches between clubs (available in large quantities) andmatches between national teams (available only in limited quantities). Weevaluate our approach on the Euro 2008, 2012 and 2016 final tournaments.

Whitaker, Ricardo Silva, Daniel Edwards, Ioannis Kosmidis;2017/09/25;http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00001v2;We consider the task of determining a football player's ability for a givenevent type, for example, scoring a goal. We propose an interpretable Bayesianmodel which is fit using variational inference methods. We implement a Poissonmodel to capture occurrences of event types, from which we infer playerabilities. Our approach also allows the visualisation of differences betweenplayers, for a specific ability, through the marginal posterior variationaldensities. We then use these inferred player abilities to extend the Bayesianhierarchical model of Baio and Blangiardo (2010) which captures a team'sscoring rate (the rate at which they score goals). We apply the resultingscheme to the English Premier League, capturing player abilities over the2013/2014 season, before using output from the hierarchical model to predictwhether over or under 2.5 goals will be scored in a given game in the 2014/2015season. This validates our model as a way of providing insights into teamformation and the individual success of sports teams.

ArXiv;A regularized hidden Markov model for analyzing the 'hot shoe' in  football;Marius Ötting, Andreas Groll;2019/11/19;http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08138v1;Although academic research on the 'hot hand' effect (in particular, insports, especially in basketball) has been going on for more than 30 years, itstill remains a central question in different areas of research whether such aneffect exists. In this contribution, we investigate the potential occurrence ofa 'hot shoe' effect for the performance of penalty takers in football based ondata from the German Bundesliga. For this purpose, we consider hidden Markovmodels (HMMs) to model the (latent) forms of players. To further account forindividual heterogeneity of the penalty taker as well as the opponent'sgoalkeeper, player-specific abilities are incorporated in the model formulationtogether with a LASSO penalty. Our results suggest states which can be tied todifferent forms of players, thus providing evidence for the hot shoe effect,and shed some light on exceptionally well-performing goalkeepers, which are ofpotential interest to managers and sports fans.
ArXiv;The UEFA Champions League seeding is not strategy-proof since the  2015/16 season;László Csató;2019/12/14;http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06804v3;Fairness has several interpretations in sports, one of them being that therules should guarantee incentive compatibility, namely, a team cannot be worseoff due to better results in any feasible scenario. The current seeding regimeof the most prestigious annual European club football tournament, the UEFA(Union of European Football Associations) Champions League, is shown to violatethis requirement since the 2015/16 season. In particular, if the titleholderqualifies for the first pot by being a champion in a high-ranked league, itsslot is given to a team from a lower-ranked association, which can harm a topclub from the domestic championship of the titleholder. However, filling allvacancies through the national leagues excludes the presence of perverseincentives. UEFA is encouraged to introduce this policy from the 2021-24 cycleonwards.
ArXiv;Forecasting football matches by predicting match statistics;Edward Wheatcroft;2020/01/24;http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09097v1;This paper considers the use of observed and predicted match statistics asinputs to forecasts of the outcomes of football matches. It is shown that, wereit possible to know the match statistics in advance, highly informativeforecasts of the match outcome could be made. Whilst, in practice, matchstatistics are never available prior to the match, this leads to a simplephilosophy. If match statistics can be predicted pre-match, and if thosepredictions are accurate enough, it follows that informative match forecastscan be made. It is shown that Generalised Attacking Performance (GAP) ratings,introduced in a recent paper, provide a suitable methodology for predictingmatch statistics in advance and that they are informative enough to provideinformation beyond that reflected in the odds. A long term and robust gamblingprofit is demonstrated when the forecasts are combined with two bettingstrategies.

In this contribution, we consider acomprehensive play-by-play NFL dataset provided by www.kaggle.com, comprising289,191 observations in total, to predict play calls in the NFL using hiddenMarkov models. The resulting out-of-sample prediction accuracy for the 2018 NFLseason is 71.5%, which is substantially higher compared to similar studies onplay call predictions in the NFL.
ArXiv;Asymmetries in football: The pass-goal paradox;D. R. Antequera, D. Garrido, I. Echegoyen, R. Lopez del Campo, R. Resta Serra, J. M. Buldu;2020/05/21;http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10816v1;"We investigate the relation between the number of passes made by a footballteam and the number of goals. We analyze the 380 matches of a complete seasonof the Spanish national league ""LaLiga"" (2018/2019). We observe how the numberof scored goals is positively correlated with the number of passes made by ateam. In this way, teams on the top (bottom) of the ranking at the end of theseason make more (less) passes than the rest of the teams. However, we observea strong asymmetry when the analysis is made depending on the part of thematch. Interestingly, fewer passes are made on the second part of a matchwhile, at the same time, more goals are scored. This paradox appears in themajority of teams, and it is independent of the number of passes made. Theseresults confirm that goals in the first part of matches are more ""costly"" interms of passes than those scored on second halves."
ArXiv;Planning to Score a Goal in Robotic Football with Heuristic Search;Ivan Khokhlov, Vladimir Litvinenko, Ilya Ryakin, Konstantin Yakovlev;2020/08/03;http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00851v2;This paper considers a problem of planning an attack in robotic football(RoboCup). The problem is reduced to finding a trajectory of the ball from itscurrent position to the opponents goals. Heuristic search algorithm, i.e. A*,is used to find such a trajectory. For this algorithm to be applicable weintroduce a discretized model of the environment, i.e. a graph, as well as thecore search components: cost function and heuristic function. Both are designedto take into account all the available information of the game state. Weextensively evaluate the suggested approach in simulation comparing it to arange of baselines. The result of the conducted evaluation clearly shows thebenefit of utilizing heuristic search within the RoboCup context.

A popular practice amongfootball fans in Brazil is to organize contests in which each participantinforms guesses on the final score of each match. The participants are thenranked according to some scoring rule. Inspired by these contests, we created awebsite to hold an online contest, in which participants were asked for theirprobabilities on the outcomes of upcoming matches of the WCT. After each roundof the tournament, the ranking of all users based on a proper scoring rule werepublished. This paper studies the performance of some methods intended toextract the wisdom of the crowds, which are aggregated forecasts that uses someor all of the forecasts available. The later methods are compared to simplerforecasting strategies as well as to statistical prediction models. Ourfindings corroborate the hypothesis that, at least for sporting events, thewisdom of the crowds offers a competitive forecasting strategy. Specifically,some of these strategies were able to achieve high scores in our contest.

Schotten;2020/10/19;http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09467v1;Mass events represent one of the most challenging scenarios for mobilenetworks because, although their date and time are usually known in advance,the actual demand for resources is difficult to predict due to its dependencyon many different factors. Based on data provided by a major European carrierduring mass events in a football stadium comprising up to 30.000 people, 16base station sectors and $1$Km$^2$ area, we performed a data-driven analysis ofthe radio access network infrastructure dynamics during such events. Given theinsights obtained from the analysis, we developed ARENA, a model-free deeplearning Radio Access Network (RAN) capacity forecasting solution that, takingas input past network monitoring data and events context information, providesguidance to mobile operators on the expected RAN capacity needed during afuture event. Our results, validated against real events contained in thedataset, illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution.

ArXiv;Home advantage of European major football leagues under COVID-19  pandemic;Eiji Konaka;2021/01/02;http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00457v2;Since March 2020, the environment surrounding football has changeddramatically because of the COVID-19 pandemic. After a few months' break,re-scheduled matches were held behind closed doors without spectators. The mainobjective of this study is a quantitative evaluation of ``crowd effects'' onhome advantage, using the results of these closed matches. The proposedanalysis uses pairwise comparison method to reduce the effects caused by theunbalanced schedule. The following conclusions were drawn from the statisticalhypothesis tests conducted in this study: In four major European leagues, thehome advantage is reduced in closed matches compared to than in the normalsituation, i.e., with spectators. The reduction amounts among leagues weredifferent. For example, in Germany, the home advantage was negative during theclosed-match period. On the other hand,in England,statistically significantdifferences in home advantage were not observed between closed matches andnormal situation.
ArXiv;Simulation-Based Decision Making in the NFL using NFLSimulatoR;Benjamin Williams, Will Palmquist, Ryan Elmore;2021/02/03;http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01846v3;In this paper, we introduce an R software package for simulating plays anddrives using play-by-play data from the National Football League. Thesimulations are generated by sampling play-by-play data from previous footballseasons.The sampling procedure adds statistical rigor to any decisions orinferences arising from examining the simulations. We highlight that thepackage is particularly useful as a data-driven tool for evaluating potentialin-game strategies or rule changes within the league. We demonstrate itsutility by evaluating the oft-debated strategy of $\textit{going for it}$ onfourth down and investigating whether or not teams should pass more than thecurrent standard.
ArXiv;Improving state estimation through projection post-processing for  activity recognition with application to football;Michał Ciszewski, Jakob Söhl, Geurt Jongbloed;2021/02/05;http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03310v3;The past decade has seen an increased interest in human activity recognitionbased on sensor data. Most often, the sensor data come unannotated, creatingthe need for fast labelling methods. For assessing the quality of thelabelling, an appropriate performance measure has to be chosen. Our maincontribution is a novel post-processing method for activity recognition. Itimproves the accuracy of the classification methods by correcting forunrealistic short activities in the estimate. We also propose a new performancemeasure, the Locally Time-Shifted Measure (LTS measure), which addressesuncertainty in the times of state changes. The effectiveness of thepost-processing method is evaluated, using the novel LTS measure, on the basisof a simulated dataset and a real application on sensor data from football. Thesimulation study is also used to discuss the choice of the parameters of thepost-processing method and the LTS measure.

The useof a feedback mechanism to alert an athlete of a potential hit may mitigate therisk for sport-related concussion and catastrophic injury by allowing athletesto effectively brace for an otherwise unforeseen impact. In this project, wecreated a proximity sensor system using radio frequency identification (RFID)technology to send haptic feedback to the wearer before a potential impact. Ourpilot test consisted of three participants who wore our novel sensor system,who ran simulated routes to represent player-to-player contact. Additionally,we used simulated data from a Network Live Football (NFL) league game tofurther validate our contact prediction algorithm. Results show that our methodcan predict players' collisions with less than 14% false-alarms.
ArXiv;Optimising Long-Term Outcomes using Real-World Fluent Objectives: An  Application to Football;Ryan Beal, Georgios Chalkiadakis, Timothy J. Norman, Sarvapali D. Ramchurn;2021/02/18;http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09469v1;In this paper, we present a novel approach for optimising long-term tacticaland strategic decision-making in football (soccer) by encapsulating events in aleague environment across a given time frame. We model the teams' objectivesfor a season and track how these evolve as games unfold to give a fluentobjective that can aid in decision-making games. We develop Markov chain MonteCarlo and deep learning-based algorithms that make use of the fluent objectivesin order to learn from prior games and other games in the environment andincrease the teams' long-term performance. Simulations of our approach usingreal-world datasets from 760 matches shows that by using optimised tactics withour fluent objective and prior games, we can on average increase teams meanexpected finishing distribution in the league by up to 35.6%.
ArXiv;Flexible marked spatio-temporal point processes with applications to  event sequences from association football;Santhosh Narayanan, Ioannis Kosmidis, Petros Dellaportas;2021/03/08;http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04647v3;We develop a new family of marked point processes by focusing thecharacteristic properties of marked Hawkes processes exclusively to the spaceof marks, providing the freedom to specify a different model for the occurrencetimes. This is possible through the decomposition of the joint distribution ofmarks and times that allows to separately specify the conditional distributionof marks given the filtration of the process and the current time. We develop aBayesian framework for the inference and prediction from this family of markedpoint processes that can naturally accommodate process and point-specificcovariate information to drive cross-excitations, offering wide flexibility andapplicability in the modelling of real-world processes. The framework is usedhere for the modelling of in-game event sequences from association football,resulting not only in inferences about previously unquantified characteristicsof game dynamics and extraction of event-specific team abilities, but also inpredictions for the occurrence of events of interest, such as goals, corners orfouls in a specified interval of time.
ArXiv;On the dependence in football match outcomes: traditional model  assumptions and an alternative proposal;Marco Petretta, Lorenzo Schiavon, Jacopo Diquigiovanni;2021/03/12;http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07272v2;The approaches routinely used to model the outcomes of football matches arecharacterised by strong assumptions about the dependence between the number ofgoals scored by the two competing teams and their marginal distribution. Inthis work, we argue that the assumptions traditionally made are not alwaysbased on solid arguments. Although most of these assumptions have been relaxedin the recent literature, the model introduced by Dixon and Coles in 1997 stillrepresents a point of reference in the betting industry. While maintaining itsconceptual simplicity, we propose a modification of the dependence structure. Areal data application suggests that our model, named Mar-Co, outperforms theDixon and Coles one in several betting scenarios, and parameter interpretationprovides key insights on league dynamics.
ArXiv;Does home advantage without crowd exist in American football?;Dávid Zoltán Szabó, Diego Andrés Pérez;2021/04/22;http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11595v1;It is well-known that home team has an inherent advantage against visitingteams when playing team sports. One of the most obvious underlying reasons, thepresence of supporting fans has mostly disappeared in major leagues with theemergence of COVID-19 pandemic. This paper investigates with the help ofhistorical National Football League (NFL) data, how much effect spectators haveon the game outcome. Our findings reveal that under no allowance of spectatorsthe home teams' performance is substantially lower than under normalcircumstances, even performing slightly worse than the visiting teams. On theother hand, when a limited amount of spectators are allowed to the game, thehome teams' performance is no longer significantly different than what weobserve with full stadiums. This suggests that from a psychological point ofview the effect of crowd support is already induced by a fraction of regularfans.
ArXiv;UEFA EURO 2020 Forecast via Nested Zero-Inflated Generalized Poisson  Regression;Lorenz A. Gilch;2021/06/09;http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05174v1;This report is devoted to the forecast of the UEFA EURO 2020, Europe'scontinental football championship, taking place across Europe in June/July2021. We present the simulation results for this tournament, where thesimulations are based on a zero-inflated generalized Poisson regression modelthat includes the Elo points of the participating teams and the location of thematches as covariates and incorporates differences of team-specific skills. Theproposed model allows predictions in terms of probabilities in order toquantify the chances for each team to reach a certain stage of the tournament.We use Monte Carlo simulations for estimating the outcome of each single matchof the tournament, from which we are able to simulate the whole tournamentitself. The model is fitted on all football games of the participating teamssince 2014 weighted by date and importance.
ArXiv;More on verification of probability forecasts for football outcomes:  score decompositions, reliability, and discrimination analyses;Jean-Louis Foulley;2021/06/28;http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14345v1;Forecast of football outcomes in terms of Home Win, Draw and Away Win relieslargely on ex ante probability elicitation of these events and ex postverification of them via computation of probability scoring rules (Brier,Ranked Probability, Logarithmic, Zero-One scores). Usually, appraisal of thequality of forecasting procedures is restricted to reporting mean score values.The purpose of this article is to propose additional tools of verification,such as score decompositions into several components of special interest.Graphical and numerical diagnoses of reliability and discrimination and kindredstatistical methods are presented using different techniques of binning (fixedthresholds, quantiles, logistic and iso regression). These procedures areillustrated on probability forecasts for the outcomes of the UEFA ChampionsLeague (C1) at the end of the group stage based on typical Poisson regressionmodels with reasonably good results in terms of reliability as compared tothose obtained from bookmaker odds and whatever the technique used. Links withresearch in machine learning and different areas of application (meteorology,medicine) are discussed.

These quantitative facts can empower newapplications like automated infographic generation. We formulate part and wholeextraction as a sequence tagging problem. Due to the large gap betweenpart/whole and its corresponding percentage, we introduce skip mechanism insequence modeling, and achieved improved performance on both our task and theCoNLL-2003 named entity recognition task. Experimental results demonstrate thatlearning to skip in sequence tagging is promising."

Providing parameter estimates with intuitiveinterpretation, a class of compound Poisson distribution including a Bayesianimplementation of geometric-Poisson distribution is introduced. Apart fromintroducing a new statistical framework, utilisation of cross-marketinformation, margin application methods to adjust bias in raw odds and theheterogeneity of overdispersion between matches are also discussed.
ArXiv;FIFA ranking: Evaluation and path forward;Leszek Szczecinski, Iris-Ioana Roatis;2021/12/20;http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00691v1;"In this work we study the ranking algorithm used by F\'ed\'erationInternationale de Football Association (FIFA); we analyze the parameters itcurrently uses, show the formal probabilistic model from which it can bederived, and optimize the latter. In particular, analyzing the games since theintroduction of the algorithm in 2018, we conclude that the game's ""importance""(as defined by FIFA) used in the algorithm is counterproductive from the pointof view of the predictive capability of the algorithm. We also postulate thealgorithm to be rooted in the formal modelling principle, where the Davidsonmodel proposed in 1970 seems to be an excellent candidate, preserving the formof the algorithm currently used. The results indicate that the predictivecapability of the algorithm is notably improved by using the home-fieldadvantage and the explicit model for the draws in the game. Moderate, butnotable improvement may be attained by introducing the weighting of the resultswith the goal differential, which although not rooted in a formal modellingprinciple, is compatible with the current algorithm and can be tuned to thecharacteristics of the football competition."
ArXiv;Distances for Comparing Multisets and Sequences;George Bolt, Simón Lunagómez, Christopher Nemeth;2022/06/17;http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08858v1;Measuring the distance between data points is fundamental to many statisticaltechniques, such as dimension reduction or clustering algorithms. However,improvements in data collection technologies has led to a growing versatilityof structured data for which standard distance measures are inapplicable. Inthis paper, we consider the problem of measuring the distance between sequencesand multisets of points lying within a metric space, motivated by the analysisof an in-play football data set. Drawing on the wider literature, includingthat of time series analysis and optimal transport, we discuss variousdistances which are available in such an instance. For each distance, we stateand prove theoretical properties, proposing possible extensions where theyfail. Finally, via an example analysis of the in-play football data, weillustrate the usefulness of these distances in practice.
ArXiv;Prediction of Football Player Value using Bayesian Ensemble Approach;Hansoo Lee, Bayu Adhi Tama, Meeyoung Cha;2022/06/24;http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13246v1;The transfer fees of sports players have become astronomical. This is becausebringing players of great future value to the club is essential for theirsurvival. We present a case study on the key factors affecting the world's topsoccer players' transfer fees based on the FIFA data analysis. To predict eachplayer's market value, we propose an improved LightGBM model by optimizing itshyperparameter using a Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) algorithm. Weidentify prominent features by the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)algorithm. The proposed method has been compared against the baselineregression models (e.g., linear regression, lasso, elastic net, kernel ridgeregression) and gradient boosting model without hyperparameter optimization.The optimized LightGBM model showed an excellent accuracy of approximately 3.8,1.4, and 1.8 times on average compared to the regression baseline models, GBDT,and LightGBM model in terms of RMSE. Our model offers interpretability indeciding what attributes football clubs should consider in recruiting playersin the future.
ArXiv;Complexity emerges in measures of the marking dynamics in football games;A. Chacoma, M. N. Kuperman, O. V. Billoni;2022/07/20;http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09992v2;In this article, we study the dynamics of marking in football matches. To dothis, we surveyed and analyzed a database containing the trajectories ofplayers from both teams on the field of play during three professional games.We describe the dynamics through the construction of temporal bipartitenetworks of proximity. Based on the introduced concept of proximity, the nodesare the players, and the links are defined between opponents that are closeenough to each other at a given moment. By studying the evolution of theheterogeneity parameter of the networks during the game, we characterized ascaling law for the average shape of the fluctuations, unveiling the emergenceof complexity in the system. Moreover, we proposed a simple model to simulatethe players' motion in the field from where we obtained the evolution of asynthetic proximity network. We show that the model captures with a remarkableagreement the complexity of the empirical case, hence it proves to be helpfulto elucidate the underlying mechanisms responsible for the observed phenomena.
ArXiv;Predicting Football Match Outcomes with eXplainable Machine Learning and  the Kelly Index;Yiming Ren, Teo Susnjak;2022/11/28;http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15734v1;In this work, a machine learning approach is developed for predicting theoutcomes of football matches. The novelty of this research lies in theutilisation of the Kelly Index to first classify matches into categories whereeach one denotes the different levels of predictive difficulty. Classificationmodels using a wide suite of algorithms were developed for each category ofmatches in order to determine the efficacy of the approach. In conjunction tothis, a set of previously unexplored features were engineering includingElo-based variables.  The dataset originated from the Premier League match data covering the2019-2021 seasons. The findings indicate that the process of decomposing thepredictive problem into sub-tasks was effective and produced competitiveresults with prior works, while the ensemble-based methods were the mosteffective.  The paper also devised an investment strategy in order to evaluate itseffectiveness by benchmarking against bookmaker odds. An approach was developedthat minimises risk by combining the Kelly Index with the predefined confidencethresholds of the predictive models. The experiments found that the proposedstrategy can return a profit when following a conservative approach thatfocuses primarily on easy-to-predict matches where the predictive modelsdisplay a high confidence level.

Although movements are ultimately executed at thelevel of instantaneous muscle tensions or joint torques, they must be selectedto serve goals defined on much longer timescales, and in terms of relationsthat extend far beyond the body itself, ultimately involving coordination withother agents. Recent research in artificial intelligence has shown the promiseof learning-based approaches to the respective problems of complex movement,longer-term planning and multi-agent coordination. However, there is limitedresearch aimed at their integration. We study this problem by training teams ofphysically simulated humanoid avatars to play football in a realistic virtualenvironment. We develop a method that combines imitation learning, single- andmulti-agent reinforcement learning and population-based training, and makes useof transferable representations of behaviour for decision making at differentlevels of abstraction. In a sequence of stages, players first learn to controla fully articulated body to perform realistic, human-like movements such asrunning and turning; they then acquire mid-level football skills such asdribbling and shooting; finally, they develop awareness of others and play as ateam, bridging the gap between low-level motor control at a timescale ofmilliseconds, and coordinated goal-directed behaviour as a team at thetimescale of tens of seconds. We investigate the emergence of behaviours atdifferent levels of abstraction, as well as the representations that underliethese behaviours using several analysis techniques, including statistics fromreal-world sports analytics.

ArXiv;Socio-Spatial Pareto Frontiers of Twitter Networks;Brandon Oselio, Alex Kulesza, Alfred Hero;2015/06/30;http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08916v1;Social media provides a rich source of networked data. This data isrepresented by a set of nodes and a set of relations (edges). It is oftenpossible to obtain or infer multiple types of relations from the same set ofnodes, such as observed friend connections, inferred links via semanticcomparison, or relations based off of geographic proximity. These edge sets canbe represented by one multi-layer network. In this paper we review a method toperform community detection of multilayer networks, and illustrate its use as avisualization tool for analyzing different community partitions. The algorithmis illustrated on a dataset from Twitter, specifically regarding the NationalFootball League (NFL).
ArXiv;Learning from the News: Predicting Entity Popularity on Twitter;Pedro Saleiro, Carlos Soares;2016/07/11;http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03057v1;In this work, we tackle the problem of predicting entity popularity onTwitter based on the news cycle. We apply a supervised learn- ing approach andextract four types of features: (i) signal, (ii) textual, (iii) sentiment and(iv) semantic, which we use to predict whether the popularity of a given entitywill be high or low in the following hours. We run several experiments on sixdifferent entities in a dataset of over 150M tweets and 5M news and obtained F1scores over 0.70. Error analysis indicates that news perform better onpredicting entity popularity on Twitter when they are the primary informationsource of the event, in opposition to events such as live TV broadcasts,political debates or football matches.

Performance is not a static measure but a somewhatvolatile one. Analyzing performance as a time series rather than a stationarypoint in time is crucial to making better decisions. This paper introduces andexplores I-VAEP and O-VAEP models to evaluate actions and rate players'intention and execution. Then, we analyze these ratings over time and proposeuse cases to fundament our option of treating player ratings as a continuousproblem. As a result, we present who were the best players and how theirperformance evolved, define volatility metrics to measure a player'sconsistency, and build a player development curve to assist decision-making.

We prove that any compactRiemann surface with a CSC-1 reducible conformal metric of finite conicalsingularities can be divided into a finite number of pieces by cutting alonggeodesics where each piece is isometric to some football. This allows us tostudy the existence of CSC-1 reducible conformal metrics with finite conicalsingularities on a compact Riemann surface. As an application, we give an anglecondition of the existence of CSC-1 reducible conformal metrics with finiteconical singularities on a compact Riemann surface.
ArXiv;Named Entity Recognition Using Web Document Corpus;Wahiba Ben Abdessalem Karaa;2011/02/28;http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.5728v1;"This paper introduces a named entity recognition approach in textual corpus.This Named Entity (NE) can be a named: location, person, organization, date,time, etc., characterized by instances. A NE is found in texts accompanied bycontexts: words that are left or right of the NE. The work mainly aims atidentifying contexts inducing the NE's nature. As such, The occurrence of theword ""President"" in a text, means that this word or context may be followed bythe name of a president as President ""Obama"". Likewise, a word preceded by thestring ""footballer"" induces that this is the name of a footballer. NErecognition may be viewed as a classification method, where every word isassigned to a NE class, regarding the context. The aim of this study is then toidentify and classify the contexts that are most relevant to recognize a NE,those which are frequently found with the NE. A learning approach usingtraining corpus: web documents, constructed from learning examples is thensuggested. Frequency representations and modified tf-idf representations areused to calculate the context weights associated to context frequency, learningexample frequency, and document frequency in the corpus."

Mantzaris, Amanda Otley, Peter Laflin;2014/06/08;http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2017v1;We propose a novel mathematical model for the activity of microbloggersduring an external, event-driven spike. The model leads to a testableprediction of who would become most active if a spike were to take place. Thistype of information is of great interest to commercial organisations,governments and charities, as it identifies key players who can be targetedwith information in real time when the network is most receptive. The modeltakes account of the fact that dynamic interactions evolve over an underlying,static network that records who listens to whom. The model is based on theassumption that, in the case where the entire community has become aware of anexternal news event, a key driver of activity is the motivation to participateby responding to incoming messages. We test the model on a large scale Twitterconversation concerning the appointment of a UK Premier League football clubmanager. We also present further results for a Bundesliga football match, amarketing event and a television programme. In each case we find thatexploiting the underlying connectivity structure improves the prediction of whowill be active during a spike. We also show how the half-life of a spike inactivity can be quantified in terms of the network size and the typicalresponse rate.
ArXiv;The football {5, 6, 6} and its geometries: from a sport tool to  fullerens and further;Emil Molnár, István Prok, Jenő Szirmai;2017/03/07;http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02264v1;This presentation starts with the regular polygons, of course, then with thePlatonic and Archimedean solids. The latter ones are whose symmetry groups aretransitive on the vertices, and in addition, whose faces are regular polygons(see only I. Prok's home page [11] for them). Then there come these symmetrygroups themselves (starting with the cube and octahedron, of course, thenicosahedron and dodecahedron). Then come the space filling properties: Namelythe cube is a space filler for the Euclidean space E^3. Then we jump for theother regular solids that cannot fil E^3, but can hyperbolic space H^3, a newspace. These can be understood better if we start regular polygons, of course,that cannot fil E^2 in general, but can fil the new plane H2, as hyperbolic orBolyai-Lobachevsky plane. Now it raises the problem, whether a footballpolyhedron - with its congruent copies - fil a space. It turns out that E^3 isexcluded (it remains an open problem - for you, of course, in other aspects),but H^3 can be filled as a schematic construction show this (Fig. 5), far fromelementary. Then we mention some stories on Buckminster Fuller, an architect,who imagined first time fullerens as such crystal structures. Many problemsremain open, of course, we are just in the middle of living science.

Like an infectious disease, discussion regardingDeflategate grew rapidly on social media sites in the hours and days after therelease of the story. However, after the Super Bowl was over, the scandalslowly began to dissipate and lost much of the attention it had originally had,as interest in the NFL wained at the completion of its season. We construct asimple epidemic model for the infectiousness of the Deflategate news story. Wethen use data from the social media site Twitter to estimate the parameters ofthis model using standard techniques from the study of inverse problems. Wefind that the infectiousness (as measured by the basic reproduction number) ofDeflategate rivals that of any infectious disease that we are aware of, and isactually more infectious than recent news stories of greater importance - bothin terms of the basic reproduction number and in terms of the average amount oftime the average tweeter continued to tweet about the news story.

Whileseveral betting strategies have been proposed to beat bookmakers, from expertprediction models and arbitrage strategies to odds bias exploitation, theirreturns have been inconsistent and it remains to be shown that a bettingstrategy can outperform the online sports betting market. We designed astrategy to beat football bookmakers with their own numbers. Instead ofbuilding a forecasting model to compete with bookmakers predictions, weexploited the probability information implicit in the odds publicly availablein the marketplace to find bets with mispriced odds. Our strategy provedprofitable in a 10-year historical simulation using closing odds, a 6-monthhistorical simulation using minute to minute odds, and a 5-month period duringwhich we staked real money with the bookmakers (we made code, data and modelspublicly available). Our results demonstrate that the football betting marketis inefficient - bookmakers can be consistently beaten across thousands ofgames in both simulated environments and real-life betting. We provide adetailed description of our betting experience to illustrate how the sportsgambling industry compensates these market inefficiencies with discriminatorypractices against successful clients.

In the case of afootball field, the area to cover is large, thus several regular cameras shouldbe used, which makes the setup expensive and complex. As an alternative, wedeveloped a system that detects players from a unique cheap and wide-anglefisheye camera assisted by a single narrow-angle thermal camera. In this work,we train a network in a knowledge distillation approach in which the studentand the teacher have different modalities and a different view of the samescene. In particular, we design a custom data augmentation combined with amotion detection algorithm to handle the training in the region of the fisheyecamera not covered by the thermal one. We show that our solution is effectivein detecting players on the whole field filmed by the fisheye camera. Weevaluate it quantitatively and qualitatively in the case of an onlinedistillation, where the student detects players in real time while beingcontinuously adapted to the latest video conditions.

To accomplish that, this study develops an integrative theoreticalmodel of team performance to explain HA based on prior literature, pushing itslimits to unfold the manager role in such a persistent pattern of performancein soccer. Data on one decade of the national tournament of Brazil was obtainedfrom public sources, including information about matches and coaches of all 12teams who played these competitions. Our conceptual modeling allows anempirical analysis of HA and performance that covers the effects of tactics,presence of supporters in matches and team fatigue via logistic regression. Theresults confirm the HA in the elite division of Brazilian soccer across alllevels of comparative technical quality, a new variable introduced to controlfor a potential technical gap between teams (something that would turn themanagerial influence null). Further analysis provides evidence that highlightsmanagerial capacity to block the HA effect above and beyond the influences offatigue (distance traveled) and density of people in the matches. This is thecase of coaches Abel Braga, Marcelo Fernandes and Roger Machado, who werecapable to reverse HA when playing against teams of similar quality. Overall,the home advantage diminishes as the comparative quality increases butdisappears only when the two teams are of extremely different technicalquality."
ArXiv;A Probabilistic Model for Predicting Shot Success in Football;Edward Wheatcroft, Ewelina Sienkiewicz;2021/01/06;http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02104v1;Football forecasting models traditionally rate teams on past match results,that is based on the number of goals scored. Goals, however, involve a highelement of chance and thus past results often do not reflect the performancesof the teams. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that accountingfor other match events such as shots at goal can provide a better indication ofthe relative strengths of two teams than the number of goals scored. Forecastmodels based on this information have been shown to be successful inoutperforming those based purely on match results. A notable weakness, however,is that this approach does not take into account differences in the probabilityof shot success among teams. A team that is more likely to score from a shotwill need fewer shots to win a match, on average. In this paper, we propose asimple parametric model to predict the probability of a team scoring, given ithas taken a shot at goal. We show that the resulting forecasts are able tooutperform a model assuming an equal probability of shot success among allteams. We then show that the model can be combined with predictions of thenumber of shots achieved by each team, and can increase the skill of forecastsof both the match outcome and of whether the total number of goals in a matchwill exceed 2.5. We assess the performance of the forecasts alongside twobetting strategies and find mixed evidence for improved performance.

Footballleagues were suddenly stopped and each country was hesitating between arelaunch of the competition and a premature ending. Some opted for the latteroption, and took as the final standing of the season the ranking from themoment the competition got interrupted. This decision has been perceived asunfair, especially by those teams who had remaining matches against easieropponents. In this paper, we introduce a tool to calculate in a fairer way thefinal standings of domestic leagues that have to stop prematurely: ourProbabilistic Final Standing Calculator (PFSC). It is based on a stochasticmodel taking into account the results of the matches played and simulating theremaining matches, yielding the probabilities for the various possible finalrankings. We have compared our PFSC with state-of-the-art prediction models,using previous seasons which we pretend to stop at different points in time. Weillustrate our PFSC by showing how a probabilistic ranking of the French Ligue1 in the stopped 2019-2020 season could have led to alternative, potentiallyfairer, decisions on the final standing.

Camarillo;2021/02/10;http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05728v1;Wearable devices have been shown to effectively measure the head movementduring impacts in sports like American football. When a head impact occurs, thedevice is triggered to collect and save the kinematic measurements during apredefined time window. Then, based on the collected kinematics, finite element(FE) head models can calculate brain strain, which is used to evaluate the riskof mild traumatic brain injury. To find a time window that can provide asufficient duration of kinematics for FE analysis, we investigated 118 on-fieldvideo-confirmed head impacts collected by the Stanford Instrumented Mouthguard.Because the individual differences in brain geometry influence thesecalculations, we included six representative brain geometries and found thatlarger brains need a longer time window of kinematics for accurate calculation.Among the different sizes of brains, a pre-trigger time of 20 ms and apost-trigger time of 70 ms were found to yield calculations of brain strain andstrain rate that were not significantly different from calculations using theoriginal 200 ms time window recorded by the mouthguard.

Camarillo;2021/08/07;http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03498v1;Traumatic brain injury can be caused by various types of head impacts.However, due to different kinematic characteristics, many brain injury riskestimation models are not generalizable across the variety of impacts thathumans may sustain. The current definitions of head impact subtypes are basedon impact sources (e.g., football, traffic accident), which may not reflect theintrinsic kinematic similarities of impacts across the impact sources. Toinvestigate the potential new definitions of impact subtypes based onkinematics, 3,161 head impacts from various sources including simulation,college football, mixed martial arts, and car racing were collected. We appliedthe K-means clustering to cluster the impacts on 16 standardized temporalfeatures from head rotation kinematics. Then, we developed subtype-specificridge regression models for cumulative strain damage (using the threshold of15%), which significantly improved the estimation accuracy compared with thebaseline method which mixed impacts from different sources and developed onemodel (R^2 from 0.7 to 0.9). To investigate the effect of kinematic features,we presented the top three critical features (maximum resultant angularacceleration, maximum angular acceleration along the z-axis, maximum linearacceleration along the y-axis) based on regression accuracy and used logisticregression to find the critical points for each feature that partitioned thesubtypes. This study enables researchers to define head impact subtypes in adata-driven manner, which leads to more generalizable brain injury riskestimation.

TheBowl Championship Series (BCS) standings employed to select the teams invitedto this game are intended to provide an unequivocal #1 v. #2 game for thechampionship; however, this selection process has itself been highlycontroversial in recent years. The computer algorithms that constitute one partof the BCS standings often act as lightning rods for the controversy, in partbecause they are inadequately explained to the public. We present analternative algorithm that is simply explained yet remains effective at rankingthe best teams. We define a ranking in terms of biased random walkers on thegraph formed by the schedule of games played, with two teams (vertices)connected by an edge if they played each other. Each random walker moves fromteam to team by selecting a game and ""voting"" for its winner with probabilityp, tracing out a never-ending path motivated by the ""my team beat your team""argument. We study the statistical properties of a collection of such walkers,relate the rankings to the community structure of the underlying network, anddemonstrate the results for recent NCAA Division I-A seasons. We also discussthe algorithm's asymptotic behavior, illustrated with some analyticallytractable cases for round-robin tournaments, and discuss possiblegeneralizations."

Most authors seem to equate this issue with the oneof finding the maximum value of the modularity, as defined by Newman. Since theproblem formulated this way is NP-hard, most effort has gone into theconstruction of search algorithms, and less to the question of other measuresof community structures, similarities between various partitionings and thevalidation with respect to external information. Here we concentrate on a classof computer generated networks and on three well-studied real networks whichconstitute a bench-mark for network studies; the karate club, the US collegefootball teams and a gene network of yeast. We utilize some standard ways ofclustering data (originally not designed for finding community structures innetworks) and show that these classical methods sometimes outperform the newerones. We discuss various measures of the strength of the modular structure, andshow by examples features and drawbacks. Further, we compare differentpartitions by applying some graph-theoretic concepts of distance, whichindicate that one of the quality measures of the degree of modularitycorresponds quite well with the distance from the true partition. Finally, weintroduce a way to validate the partitionings with respect to external datawhen the nodes are classified but the network structure is unknown. This ishere possible since we know everything of the computer generated networks, aswell as the historical answer to how the karate club and the football teams arepartitioned in reality. The partitioning of the gene network is validated byuse of the Gene Ontology database, where we show that a community in generalcorresponds to a biological process."

Thestudy population was player-seasons from 2007-2016. We included regular season,non-illness, non-head, game-loss injuries. Injuries were identified using adatabase from Football Outsiders. The primary outcomes were overall,conditioning-dependent and non-conditioning-dependent injury counts by season.We examined time trends in injury counts before (2007-2010) and after(2011-2016) the CBA using a Poisson interrupted time series model. The numberof game-loss regular season, non-head, non-illness injuries grew from 701 in2007 to 804 in 2016 (15% increase). The number of regular season weeks missedexhibited a similar increase. Conditioning-dependent injuries increased from197 in 2007 to 271 in 2011 (38% rise), but were lower and remained relativelyunchanged at 220-240 injuries per season thereafter. Non-conditioning injuriesdecreased by 37% in the first three years of the new CBA before returning tohistoric levels in 2014-2016. Poisson models for all, conditioning-dependent,and non-conditioning-dependent game-loss injury counts did not showstatistically significant or meaningful detrimental changes associated with theCBA. We did not observe an increase in injuries following the 2011 CBA. Otherconcurrent injury-related rule and regulation changes limit specific causalinferences about the practice restrictions, however.

In the present study,metabolomic profiling was combined with inflammatory miRNA quantification,computational behavior with virtual reality (VR) testing of motor control, andhead collision event monitoring to explore trans-omic and collision effects onhuman behavior across a season of players on a collegiate American footballteam. We integrated permutation-based statistics with mediation analyses totest complex, directional relationships between miRNAs, metabolites, and VRtask performance. Fourteen significant mediations (metabolite = mediator; miRNA= independent variable; VR score = dependent variable) were discovered atpreseason (N=6) and across season (N=8) with Sobel p-values less than or equalto 0.05 and with total effects at or exceeding 50%. The majority of mediationfindings involved long to medium chain fatty acids (2-HG, 8-HOA, UND, sebacate,suberate, and heptanoate). In parallel, TCA metabolites were found to besignificantly decreased at postseason relative to preseason. HAEs wereassociated with metabolomic measures and miRNA levels across-season. Together,these observations suggest a state of chronic HAE-induced neuroinflammation (asevidence by elevated miRNAs) and mitochondrial dysfunction (as observed byabnormal FAs and TCA metabolites) that together produce subtle changes inneurological function (as observed by impaired motor control behavior). Thesefindings point to a shift in mitochondrial metabolism, away from mitochondriafunction, consistent with other illnesses classified as mitochondrialdisorders, suggesting a plausible mechanism underlying HAEs in contact sportsand potential avenue for treatment intervention."

Breiter;2020/06/23;http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14930v1;Collision sports athletes experience many head acceleration events (HAEs) perseason. The effects of these subconcussive events are largely understudiedsince HAEs may produce no overt symptoms, and are likely to diffusely manifestacross multiple scales of study (e.g., molecular, cellular network, andbehavior). This study integrated resting-state fMRI with metabolome,transcriptome and computational virtual reality (VR) behavior measures toassess the effects of exposure to HAEs on players in a collegiate Americanfootball team. Permutation-based mediation and moderation analysis was used toinvestigate relationships between network fingerprint, changes in omic measuresand VR metrics over the season. Change in an energy cycle fatty acid,tridecenedioate, moderated the relationship between 1) miR-505 and DMNfingerprint and 2) the relationship between DMN fingerprint and worsening VRBalance measures (all p less than or equal to 0.05). In addition, thesimilarity in DMN over the season was negatively related to cumulative numberof HAEs above 80G, and DMN fingerprint was less similar across the season inathletes relative to age-matched non-athletes. miR-505 was also positivelyrelated to average number of HAEs above 25G per session. It is important tonote that tridecenedioate has a double bond making it a candidate for ROSscavenging. These findings between a candidate ROS-related metabolite,inflammatory miRNA, altered brain imaging and diminished behavioral performancesuggests that impact athletes may experience chronic neuroinflammation. Therigorous permutation-based mediation/moderation may provide a methodology forinvestigating complex multi-scale biological data within humans alone and thusassist study of other functional brain problems.

To quantify brain injury riskbased on measurements of kinematics on the head, finite element (FE) models andvarious brain injury criteria based on different factors of these kinematicshave been developed, but the contribution of different kinematic factors hasnot been comprehensively analyzed across different types of head impacts in adata-driven manner. To better design brain injury criteria, the predictivepower of rotational kinematics factors, which are different in 1) thederivative order (angular velocity, angular acceleration, angular jerk), 2) thedirection and 3) the power (e.g., square-rooted, squared, cubic) of the angularvelocity, were analyzed based on different datasets including laboratoryimpacts, American football, mixed martial arts (MMA), NHTSA automobilecrashworthiness tests and NASCAR crash events. Ordinary least squaresregressions were built from kinematics factors to the 95\% maximum principalstrain (MPS95), and we compared zero-order correlation coefficients, structurecoefficients, commonality analysis, and dominance analysis. The angularacceleration, the magnitude, and the first power factors showed the highestpredictive power for the majority of impacts including laboratory impacts,American football impacts, with few exceptions (angular velocity for MMA andNASCAR impacts). The predictive power of rotational kinematics in threedirections (x: posterior-to-anterior, y: left-to-right, z:superior-to-inferior) of kinematics varied with different sports and types ofhead impacts.

Camarillo;2021/04/19;http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09082v3;Objective: Traumatic brain injury can be caused by head impacts, but manybrain injury risk estimation models are not equally accurate across the varietyof impacts that patients may undergo and the characteristics of different typesof impacts are not well studied. We investigated the spectral characteristicsof different head impact types with kinematics classification. Methods: Datawas analyzed from 3,262 head impacts from lab reconstruction, Americanfootball, mixed martial arts, and publicly available car crash data. A randomforest classifier with spectral densities of linear acceleration and angularvelocity was built to classify head impact types (e.g., football, car crash,mixed martial arts). To test the classifier robustness, another 271lab-reconstructed impacts were obtained from 5 other instrumented mouthguards.Finally, with the classifier, type-specific, nearest-neighbor regression modelswere built for brain strain. Results: The classifier reached a median accuracyof 96% over 1,000 random partitions of training and test sets. The mostimportant features in the classification included both low-frequency andhigh-frequency features, both linear acceleration features and angular velocityfeatures. Different head impact types had different distributions of spectraldensities in low-frequency and high-frequency ranges (e.g., the spectraldensities of MMA impacts were higher in high-frequency range than in thelow-frequency range). The type-specific regression showed a generally higherR^2-value than baseline models without classification. Conclusion: Themachine-learning-based classifier enables a better understanding of the impactkinematics spectral density in different sports, and it can be applied toevaluate the quality of impact-simulation systems and on-field dataaugmentation.
ArXiv;Physics-informed machine learning improves detection of head impacts;Samuel J. Raymond, Nicholas J. Cecchi, Hossein Vahid Alizadeh, Ashlyn A. Callan, Eli Rice, Yuzhe Liu, Zhou Zhou, Michael Zeineh, David B. Camarillo;2021/08/19;http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08797v1;In this work we present a new physics-informed machine learning model thatcan be used to analyze kinematic data from an instrumented mouthguard anddetect impacts to the head. Monitoring player impacts is vitally important tounderstanding and protecting from injuries like concussion. Typically, toanalyze this data, a combination of video analysis and sensor data is used toascertain the recorded events are true impacts and not false positives. Infact, due to the nature of using wearable devices in sports, false positivesvastly outnumber the true positives. Yet, manual video analysis istime-consuming. This imbalance leads traditional machine learning approaches toexhibit poor performance in both detecting true positives and preventing falsenegatives. Here, we show that by simulating head impacts numerically using astandard Finite Element head-neck model, a large dataset of synthetic impactscan be created to augment the gathered, verified, impact data from mouthguards.This combined physics-informed machine learning impact detector reportedimproved performance on test datasets compared to traditional impact detectorswith negative predictive value and positive predictive values of 88% and 87%respectively. Consequently, this model reported the best results to date for animpact detection algorithm for American Football, achieving an F1 score of0.95. In addition, this physics-informed machine learning impact detector wasable to accurately detect true and false impacts from a test dataset at a rateof 90% and 100% relative to a purely manual video analysis workflow. Savingover 12 hours of manual video analysis for a modest dataset, at an overallaccuracy of 92%, these results indicate that this model could be used in placeof, or alongside, traditional video analysis to allow for larger scale and moreefficient impact detection in sports such as American Football.

This work presents the firststudy of its kind in which feature importance for QML models has been exploredand contrasted against their classical machine learning (CML) equivalents. Wedeveloped a hybrid quantum-classical architecture where QML models are trainedand feature importance values are calculated from classical algorithms on areal-world dataset. This architecture has been implemented on ESPN FantasyFootball data using Qiskit statevector simulators and IBM quantum hardware suchas the IBMQ Mumbai and IBMQ Montreal systems. Even though we are in the NoisyIntermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the physical quantum computing resultsare promising. To facilitate current quantum scale, we created a data tiering,model aggregation, and novel validation methods. Notably, the featureimportance magnitudes from the quantum models had a much higher variation whencontrasted to classical models. We can show that equivalent QML and CML modelsare complementary through diversity measurements. The diversity between QML andCML demonstrates that both approaches can contribute to a solution in differentways. Within this paper we focus on Quantum Support Vector Classifiers (QSVC),Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC), and their classical counterparts. The ESPNand IBM fantasy football Trade Assistant combines advanced statistical analysiswith the natural language processing of Watson Discovery to serve uppersonalized trade recommendations that are fair. Here, player valuation dataof each player has been considered and this work can be extended to calculatethe feature importance of other QML models such as Quantum Boltzmann machines.

ArXiv;Community Detection in Complex Networks Using Agents;Ismail Gunes, Haluk Bingol;2006/10/23;http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0610129v1;Community structure identification has been one of the most popular researchareas in recent years due to its applicability to the wide scale ofdisciplines. To detect communities in varied topics, there have been manyalgorithms proposed so far. However, most of them still have some drawbacks tobe addressed. In this paper, we present an agent-based based communitydetection algorithm. The algorithm that is a stochastic one makes use of agentsby forcing them to perform biased moves in a smart way. Using the informationcollected by the traverses of these agents in the network, the networkstructure is revealed. Also, the network modularity is used for determining thenumber of communities. Our algorithm removes the need for prior knowledge aboutthe network such as number of the communities or any threshold values.Furthermore, the definite community structure is provided as a result insteadof giving some structures requiring further processes. Besides, thecomputational and time costs are optimized because of using thread like workingagents. The algorithm is tested on three network data of different types andsizes named Zachary karate club, college football and political books. For allthree networks, the real network structures are identified in almost every run.

Matter can be localized on a codimension one branecoupled to the bulk gauge field and wrapped around an axis of symmetry of theinternal space. By studying the linear perturbations around this background, weshow that the gravitational interaction between sources on the brane isdescribed by Einstein 4d gravity at large distances. Our model provides aconsistent setup for the study of gravity in the rugby (or football)compactification, without having to deal with the complications of adelta-like, codimension two brane. To our knowledge, this is the first completestudy of gravity in a realistic brane model with two extra dimensions, in whichthe mechanism of stabilization of the extra space is consistently taken intoaccount.
ArXiv;Using Synchronic and Diachronic Relations for Summarizing Multiple  Documents Describing Evolving Events;Stergos D. Afantenos, V. Karkaletsis, P. Stamatopoulos, C. Halatsis;2007/10/18;http://arxiv.org/abs/0710.3502v1;In this paper we present a fresh look at the problem of summarizing evolvingevents from multiple sources. After a discussion concerning the nature ofevolving events we introduce a distinction between linearly and non-linearlyevolving events. We present then a general methodology for the automaticcreation of summaries from evolving events. At its heart lie the notions ofSynchronic and Diachronic cross-document Relations (SDRs), whose aim is theidentification of similarities and differences between sources, from asynchronical and diachronical perspective. SDRs do not connect documents ortextual elements found therein, but structures one might call messages.Applying this methodology will yield a set of messages and relations, SDRs,connecting them, that is a graph which we call grid. We will show how such agrid can be considered as the starting point of a Natural Language GenerationSystem. The methodology is evaluated in two case-studies, one for linearlyevolving events (descriptions of football matches) and another one fornon-linearly evolving events (terrorist incidents involving hostages). In bothcases we evaluate the results produced by our computational systems.

ArXiv;Community Detecting By Signaling on Complex Networks;Yanqing Hu, Menghui Li, Peng Zhang, Ying Fan, Zengru Di;2007/10/29;http://arxiv.org/abs/0710.5441v1;Based on signaling process on complex networks, a method for identificationcommunity structure is proposed. For a network with $n$ nodes, every node isassumed to be a system which can send, receive, and record signals. Each nodeis taken as the initial signal source once to inspire the whole network byexciting its neighbors and then the source node is endowed a $n$d vector whichrecording the effects of signaling process. So by this process, the topologicalrelationship of nodes on networks could be transferred into the geometricalstructure of vectors in $n$d Euclidian space. Then the best partition of groupsis determined by $F$-statistic and the final community structure is given byFuzzy $C$-means clustering method (FCM). This method can detect communitystructure both in unweighted and weighted networks without any extraparameters. It has been applied to ad hoc networks and some real networksincluding Zachary Karate Club network and football team network. The resultsare compared with that of other approaches and the evidence indicates that thealgorithm based on signaling process is effective.

A community isdefined as a set of nodes, which satisfy that each node's degree inside thecommunity should not be smaller than the node's degree toward any othercommunity. In the algorithm, the attractive force of a community to a node isdefined as the connections between them. Then employing attractive force basedself-organizing process, without any extra parameter, the best communities canbe detected. Several artificial and real-world networks, including ZacharyKarate club network and College football network are analyzed. The algorithmworks well in detecting communities and it also gives a nice description fornetwork division and group formation.
ArXiv;Supersymmetric codimension-two branes and U(1)_R mediation in 6D gauged  supergravity;Hyun Min Lee;2008/03/18;http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.2683v2;We construct a consistent supersymmetric action for brane chiral and vectormultiplets in a six-dimensional chiral gauged supergravity. A nonzero branetension can be accommodated by allowing for a brane-localized Fayet-Iliopoulosterm proportional to the brane tension. When the brane chiral multiplet ischarged under the bulk U(1)_R, we obtain a nontrivial coupling to the extracomponent of the U(1)_R gauge field strength as well as a singular scalarself-interaction term. Dimensionally reducing to 4D on a footballsupersymmetric solution, we discuss the implication of such interactions forobtaining the U(1)_R D-term in the 4D effective supergravity. By assuming thebulk gaugino condensates and nonzero brane F- and/or D-term for the upliftingpotential, we have all the moduli stabilized with a vanishing cosmologicalconstant. The brane scalar with nonzero R charge then gets a soft mass of orderthe gravitino mass. The overall sign of the soft mass squared depends on thesign of the R charge as well as whether the brane F- or D-term dominates.

The sum of thesespectral components in the frequency band near 309 {\mu}Hz produces a beat thatgives the overall amplitude envelope a characteristic, regular pattern. Fromthe measured envelope the parameters frequency, amplitude, phase and damping ofgenerating sinusoids can be reconstructed. Since the method is extremelysensitive to changes in frequency and phase, these quantities can be determinedprecisely. The results depend on the geographical location of the site. Furtherresults are the half-life of the amplitude decrease and the resonator Q. It isshown that the interaction of the five individual frequencies can beinterpreted as amplitude modulation, which requires a nonlinear process in theEarth's interior.

We find that it isdifficult to improve over simple averaging of the predictions in terms ofprediction accuracy, but that there is room for improvement in quadratic loss.Somewhat surprisingly, a Bayesian estimation algorithm which estimates thevariance of each expert's prediction exhibits the most consistent superiorperformance over simple averaging among our collection of algorithms.

A popular example is rankingcontestants in sport tournaments. To this purpose, paired comparison modelssuch as the Bradley-Terry model are often used. This paper suggests fittingpaired comparison models with a lasso-type procedure that forces contestantswith similar abilities to be classified into the same group. Benefits of theproposed method are easier interpretation of rankings and a significantimprovement of the quality of predictions with respect to the standard maximumlikelihood fitting. Numerical aspects of the proposed method are discussed indetail.

ArXiv;Supermassive galactic centre with repulsive gravity;Trevor W. Marshall, Max K. Wallis;2013/03/18;http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5604v2;"Repulsive gravity has its origin in the 1939 article of Oppenheimer andSnyder which describes a collapsar, that is an idealized star ofnon-interacting material (dust) collapsing under its own gravity. The stellarmaterial has a final state resembling a football, that is a significant part ofit is concentrated in a thin surface shell. An interior pressure is exerted bythe strong gravitational field, equivalent to a negative mass. However, the OSsolution has been misunderstood, the shell's position being incorrectlyidentified with the ""event horizon"" in black-hole theory. While half thematerial is concentrated in a shell occupying a small fraction of the radius,some material is spread throughout the interior, unlike the concentration in ablack hole's singularity. We deal with the singularity in density at the shellsurface, by including Fermi pressure of degenerate electrons for a shelldensity comparable to a solar mass-sized white dwarf. Because the high-densityregion is concentrated in a shell, instead of at the centre as in a black hole,our conclusion is that repulsive gravity enables the existence of supermassivewhite dwarfs."

Din-Houn Lau, Axel Gandy;2013/07/02;http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0742v7;A system to update estimates from a sequence of probability distributions ispresented. The aim of the system is to quickly produce estimates with auser-specified bound on the Monte Carlo error. The estimates are based uponweighted samples stored in a database. The stored samples are maintained suchthat the accuracy of the estimates and quality of the samples is satisfactory.This maintenance involves varying the number of samples in the database andupdating their weights. New samples are generated, when required, by a Markovchain Monte Carlo algorithm. The system is demonstrated using a football leaguemodel that is used to predict the end of season table. Correctness of theestimates and their accuracy is shown in a simulation using a linear Gaussianmodel.
ArXiv;Primacy & Ranking of UEFA Soccer Teams from Biasing Organizing Rules;Marcel Ausloos, Adam Gadomski, Nikolay K. Vitanov;2014/06/18;http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4644v1;A question is raised on whether some implied regularity or structure, asfound in soccer team ranking by the Union of European Football Associations(UEFA), is due to implicit game result value or score competition conditions.The analysis is based on considerations about complex systems, i.e. searchingwhether power or other simple law fits are appropriate to describe someinternal dynamics. It is observed that the ranking is specifically organized: amajor class made of a few teams emerges after each game season. Other classeswhich apparently have regular sizes subsequently occur. Thus, the notion ofSheppard primacy index is envisaged to describe the findings. Additionalprimacy indices are discussed for enhancing the features. These measures can beused to sort out peer classes in more general terms. A very simplified toymodel containing ingredients of the UEFA ranking rules suggests that such peerclasses are an extrinsic property of the ranking, as obtained in many nonlinearsystems under boundary condition constraints.
ArXiv;A simple Bayesian procedure for forecasting the outcomes of the UEFA  Champions League matches;Jean-Louis Foulley;2015/01/23;http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05831v2;This article presents a Bayesian implementation of a cumulative probit modelto forecast the outcomes of the UEFA Champions League matches. The argument ofthe normal CDF involves a cut-off point, a home vs away playing effect and thedifference in strength of the two competing teams. Team strength is assumed tofollow a Gaussian distribution the expectation of which is expressed as alinear regression on an external rating of the team from eg the UEFA ClubRanking (UEFACR) or the Football Club World Ranking (FCWR). Priors on theseparameters are updated at the beginning of each season from their posteriordistributions obtained at the end of the previous one. This allows makingpredictions of match results for each phase of the competition: group stage andknock-out. An application is presented for the 2013-2014 season. Adjustmentbased on the FCWR performs better than on UEFACR.
ArXiv;Estimating Attendance From Cellular Network Data;Marco Mamei, Massimo Colonna;2015/04/28;http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.07385v1;We present a methodology to estimate the number of attendees to eventshappening in the city from cellular network data. In this work we usedanonymized Call Detail Records (CDRs) comprising data on where and when usersaccess the cellular network. Our approach is based on two key ideas: (1) weidentify the network cells associated to the event location. (2) We verify theattendance of each user, as a measure of whether (s)he generates CDRs duringthe event, but not during other times. We evaluate our approach to estimate thenumber of attendees to a number of events ranging from football matches instadiums to concerts and festivals in open squares. Comparing our results withthe best groundtruth data available, our estimates provide a median error ofless than 15% of the actual number of attendees.
ArXiv;Causal Inference with Two Versions of Treatment;Raiden B. Hasegawa, Sameer K. Deshpande, Dylan S. Small, Paul R. Rosenbaum;2017/05/10;http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03918v2;Causal effects are commonly defined as comparisons of the potential outcomesunder treatment and control, but this definition is threatened by thepossibility that the treatment or control condition is not well-defined,existing instead in more than one version. A simple, widely applicable analysisis proposed to address the possibility that the treatment or control conditionexists in two versions with two different treatment effects. This analysisloses no power in the main comparison of treatment and control, providesadditional information about version effects, and controls the family-wiseerror rate in several comparisons. The method is motivated and illustratedusing an on-going study of the possibility that repeated head trauma in highschool football causes an increase in risk of early on-set dementia.
ArXiv;Monte-Carlo Simulation of J1 League Postseason System from the 2015  Season;Takeshi Izumi, Eiji Konaka;2014/12/02;http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0793v3;In this paper, the new two stage and postseason system of J1 League, the topdivision of professional football in Japan, is simulated. Official regulationdefines that the new postseason from the 2015 season consists of five teamsselected by different principles --- the top three teams by total seasonpoints, and the winning teams of the 1st and 2nd half of the season.  This paper clarifies that there are overlaps within these five teams and theaverage number of teams reaching the postseason is about 3.5. The probabilitythat the postseason is held with 3, 4, and 5 teams are estimated about 0.62,0.35, and 0.03, respectively.  From this result, this paper concludes that the new system of J1 League isbasically a one-stage system, whereas the new system is officially defined as atwo-stage system, due to inappropriate design of the postseason.
ArXiv;A Comparative Analysis of Social Network Pages by Interests of Their  Followers;Elena Mikhalkova, Nadezhda Ganzherli, Yuri Karyakin;2017/07/18;http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05481v2;Being a matter of cognition, user interests should be apt to classificationindependent of the language of users, social network and content of interestitself. To prove it, we analyze a collection of English and Russian Twitter andVkontakte community pages by interests of their followers. First, we create amodel of Major Interests (MaIs) with the help of expert analysis and thenclassify a set of pages using machine learning algorithms (SVM, Neural Network,Naive Bayes, and some other). We take three interest domains that are typicalof both English and Russian-speaking communities: football, rock music,vegetarianism. The results of classification show a greater correlation betweenRussian-Vkontakte and Russian-Twitter pages while English-Twitterpages appearto provide the highest score.
ArXiv;Simultaneous Variable and Covariance Selection with the Multivariate  Spike-and-Slab Lasso;Sameer K. Deshpande, Veronika Rockova, Edward I. George;2017/08/29;http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08911v2;We propose a Bayesian procedure for simultaneous variable and covarianceselection using continuous spike-and-slab priors in multivariate linearregression models where q possibly correlated responses are regressed onto ppredictors. Rather than relying on a stochastic search through thehigh-dimensional model space, we develop an ECM algorithm similar to the EMVSprocedure of Rockova & George (2014) targeting modal estimates of the matrix ofregression coefficients and residual precision matrix. Varying the scale of thecontinuous spike densities facilitates dynamic posterior exploration and allowsus to filter out negligible regression coefficients and partial covariancesgradually. Our method is seen to substantially outperform regularizationcompetitors on simulated data. We demonstrate our method with a re-examinationof data from a recent observational study of the effect of playing high schoolfootball on several later-life cognition, psychological, and socio-economicoutcomes.
ArXiv;An Exact Approach for the Balanced k-Way Partitioning Problem with  Weight Constraints and its Application to Sports Team Realignment;Diego Recalde, Daniel Severín, Ramiro Torres, Polo Vaca;2017/09/05;http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01433v1;In this work a balanced k-way partitioning problem with weight constraints isdefined to model the sports team realignment. Sports teams must be partitionedinto a fixed number of groups according to some regulations, where the totaldistance of the road trips that all teams must travel to play a Double RoundRobin Tournament in each group is minimized. Two integer programmingformulations for this problem are introduced, and the validity of threefamilies of inequalities associated to the polytope of these formulations isproved. The performance of a tabu search procedure and a Branch & Cutalgorithm, which uses the valid inequalities as cuts, is evaluated oversimulated and real-world instances. In particular, an optimal solution for therealignment of the Ecuadorian Football league is reported and the methodologycan be suitable adapted for the realignment of other sports leagues.
ArXiv;Fiber-Flux Diffusion Density for White Matter Tracts Analysis:  Application to Mild Anomalies Localization in Contact Sports Players;Itay Benou, Ronel Veksler, Alon Friedman, Tammy Riklin Raviv;2017/09/18;http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06122v1;We present the concept of fiber-flux density for locally quantifying whitematter (WM) fiber bundles. By combining scalar diffusivity measures (e.g.,fractional anisotropy) with fiber-flux measurements, we define new localdescriptors called Fiber-Flux Diffusion Density (FFDD) vectors. Applying eachdescriptor throughout fiber bundles allows along-tract coupling of a specificdiffusion measure with geometrical properties, such as fiber orientation andcoherence. A key step in the proposed framework is the construction of an FFDDdissimilarity measure for sub-voxel alignment of fiber bundles, based on thefast marching method (FMM). The obtained aligned WM tract-profiles enablemeaningful inter-subject comparisons and group-wise statistical analysis. Wedemonstrate our method using two different datasets of contact sports players.Along-tract pairwise comparison as well as group-wise analysis, with respect tonon-player healthy controls, reveal significant and spatially-consistent FFDDanomalies. Comparing our method with along-tract FA analysis shows improvedsensitivity to subtle structural anomalies in football players over standard FAmeasurements.
ArXiv;Reagent: Converting Ordinary Webpages into Interactive Software Agents;Mathew Peveler, Jeffery Kephart, Hui Su;2018/10/27;http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11593v1;We introduce Reagent, a technology that readily converts ordinary webpagescontaining structured data into software agents with which one can interactnaturally, via a combination of speech and pointing. Previous efforts to makewebpage content manipulable by third-party software components in browsers ordesktop applications have generally relied upon specialized instrumentationincluded in the webpages -- a practice that neither scales well nor applies topre-existing webpages. In contrast, Reagent automatically captures semanticdetails and semantically-meaningful mouse events from arbitrary webpages thatcontain no pre-existing special instrumentation. Reagent combines these eventswith text transcriptions of user speech to derive and execute parameterizedcommands representing human intent. Thus, users may request variousvisualization or analytic operations to be performed on data displayed on apage by speaking to it and/or pointing to elements within it. When unable toinfer translations between event labels and human terminology, Reagentproactively asks users for definitions and adds them to its dictionary. Wedemonstrate Reagent in the context of a collection of pre-existing webpagesthat contain football team and player statistics.
ArXiv;Tidally-Distorted, Iron-Enhanced Exoplanets Closely Orbiting Their Stars;Ellen M. Price, Leslie A. Rogers;2019/01/30;http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10666v2;The transiting planet candidate KOI 1843.03 ($0.6 R_\oplus$ radius, 4.245hour orbital period, $0.46 M_\odot$ host star) has the shortest orbital periodof any planet yet discovered. Here we show, using the first three-dimensionalinterior structure simulations of ultra-short-period tidally distorted rockyexoplanets, that KOI 1843.03 may be shaped like an American football, elongatedalong the planet-star axis with an aspect ratio of up to 1.79. Furthermore, forKOI 1843.03 to have avoided tidal disruption (wherein the planet is pulledapart by the tidal gravity of its host star) on such a close-in orbit, KOI1843.03 must be as iron-rich as Mercury (about 66% by mass iron compared toMercury's 70% by mass iron, Hauck et al. 2013). Of the ultra-short-period($P_\mathrm{orb} \lesssim 1$ day) planets with physically-meaningfulconstraints on their densities characterized to date, just under half (4 out of9) are iron-enhanced. As more are discovered, we will better understand thediversity of rocky planet compositions and the variety of processes that leadto planetary iron enhancement.
ArXiv;DxNAT - Deep Neural Networks for Explaining Non-Recurring Traffic  Congestion;Fangzhou sun, Abhishek Dubey, Jules White;2018/01/30;http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00002v1;Non-recurring traffic congestion is caused by temporary disruptions, such asaccidents, sports games, adverse weather, etc. We use data related to real-timetraffic speed, jam factors (a traffic congestion indicator), and eventscollected over a year from Nashville, TN to train a multi-layered deep neuralnetwork. The traffic dataset contains over 900 million data records. Thenetwork is thereafter used to classify the real-time data and identifyanomalous operations. Compared with traditional approaches of using statisticalor machine learning techniques, our model reaches an accuracy of 98.73 percentwhen identifying traffic congestion caused by football games. Our approachfirst encodes the traffic across a region as a scaled image. After that theimage data from different timestamps is fused with event- and time-relateddata. Then a crossover operator is used as a data augmentation method togenerate training datasets with more balanced classes. Finally, we use thereceiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to tune the sensitivity of theclassifier. We present the analysis of the training time and the inference timeseparately.
ArXiv;Deep Learning for Semantic Segmentation on Minimal Hardware;Sander G. van Dijk, Marcus M. Scheunemann;2018/07/15;http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05597v1;Deep learning has revolutionised many fields, but it is still challenging totransfer its success to small mobile robots with minimal hardware.Specifically, some work has been done to this effect in the RoboCup humanoidfootball domain, but results that are performant and efficient and stillgenerally applicable outside of this domain are lacking. We propose an approachconceptually different from those taken previously. It is based on semanticsegmentation and does achieve these desired properties. In detail, it is beingable to process full VGA images in real-time on a low-power mobile processor.It can further handle multiple image dimensions without retraining, it does notrequire specific domain knowledge for achieving a high frame rate and it isapplicable on a minimal mobile hardware.
ArXiv;Real-time retrieval for case-based reasoning in interactive  multiagent-based simulations;Pierre De Loor, Romain Bénard, Chevaillier Pierre;2011/07/17;http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.3326v1;The aim of this paper is to present the principles and results aboutcase-based reasoning adapted to real- time interactive simulations, moreprecisely concerning retrieval mechanisms. The article begins by introducingthe constraints involved in interactive multiagent-based simulations. Thesecond section pre- sents a framework stemming from case-based reasoning byautonomous agents. Each agent uses a case base of local situations and, fromthis base, it can choose an action in order to interact with other auton- omousagents or users' avatars. We illustrate this framework with an examplededicated to the study of dynamic situations in football. We then go on toaddress the difficulties of conducting such simulations in real-time andpropose a model for case and for case base. Using generic agents and adequatecase base structure associated with a dedicated recall algorithm, we improveretrieval performance under time pressure compared to classic CBR techniques.We present some results relating to the performance of this solution. Thearticle concludes by outlining future development of our project.
ArXiv;Dynamical Systems Trees;Andrew Howard, Tony S. Jebara;2012/07/11;http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.4148v1;We propose dynamical systems trees (DSTs) as a flexible class of models fordescribing multiple processes that interact via a hierarchy of aggregatingparent chains. DSTs extend Kalman filters, hidden Markov models and nonlineardynamical systems to an interactive group scenario. Various individualprocesses interact as communities and sub-communities in a tree structure thatis unrolled in time. To accommodate nonlinear temporal activity, eachindividual leaf process is modeled as a dynamical system containing discreteand/or continuous hidden states with discrete and/or Gaussian emissions.Subsequent higher level parent processes act like hidden Markov models andmediate the interaction between leaf processes or between other parentprocesses in the hierarchy. Aggregator chains are parents of child processesthat they combine and mediate, yielding a compact overall parameterization. Weprovide tractable inference and learning algorithms for arbitrary DSTtopologies via an efficient structured mean-field algorithm. The diverseapplicability of DSTs is demonstrated by experiments on gene expression dataand by modeling group behavior in the setting of an American football game.
ArXiv;A Unified Approach for Modeling and Recognition of Individual Actions  and Group Activities;Qiang Qiu, Rama Chellappa;2012/08/21;http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.4398v1;"Recognizing group activities is challenging due to the difficulties inisolating individual entities, finding the respective roles played by theindividuals and representing the complex interactions among the participants.Individual actions and group activities in videos can be represented in acommon framework as they share the following common feature: both are composedof a set of low-level features describing motions, e.g., optical flow for eachpixel or a trajectory for each feature point, according to a set of compositionconstraints in both temporal and spatial dimensions. In this paper, we presenta unified model to assess the similarity between two given individual or groupactivities. Our approach avoids explicit extraction of individual actors,identifying and representing the inter-person interactions. With the proposedapproach, retrieval from a video database can be performed throughQuery-by-Example; and activities can be recognized by querying videoscontaining known activities. The suggested video matching process can beperformed in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the performance of ourapproach by recognizing a set of human actions and football plays."
ArXiv;Chiral Perturbation Theory and the $\bar B \bar B$ Strong Interaction;Zhan-Wei Liu, Ning Li, Shi-Lin Zhu;2012/11/15;http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3578v2;We have calculated the potentials of the heavy (charmed or bottomed)pseudoscalar mesons up to $O(\epsilon^2)$ with the heavy meson chiralperturbation theory. We take into account the contributions from the football,triangle, box, and crossed diagrams with the 2$\phi$ exchange and one-loopcorrections to the contact terms. We notice that the total 2$\phi$-exchangepotential alone is attractive in the small momentum region in the channel${\bar B \bar B}^{I=1}$, ${\bar B_s \bar B_s}^{I=0}$, or ${\bar B \barB_s}^{I=1/2}$, while repulsive in the channel ${\bar B \bar B}^{I=0}$.Hopefully the analytical chiral structures of the potentials may be useful inthe extrapolation of the heavy meson interaction from lattice QCD simulation.
ArXiv;Hubs and Authorities of the English Premier League for 2010-2011;Michael Leznik;2013/04/01;http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0727v1;In this work author applies well known web search algorithm Hyperlink -Induced Topic Search (HITS) to problem of ranking football teams in EnglishPremier League (EPL). The algorithm allows the ranking of the teams using thenotions of hubs and authorities well known for ranking pages in the World WideWeb. Results of the games introduced as a graph where losing team 'gives alink' to a winning team and, if draw registered both team give links to eachother. In case of a win link is weighted as three points in adjacent matrix andin case of draw as one point. Author uses notion of authority in order todefine team which win a game and hub as a team which lose a game, the winner ofthe competition defined as the 'worst' hub, team that didn't reinforced anyother team. Using this ranking system, the champion's team, which is a 'worsthub' must not lose, or draw games to other 'good authorities' teams. If by theend of the competition there are teams with an equal number of wins and lossesthen the team which has beaten more teams with higher authority ranks, wins.
ArXiv;Scoring dynamics across professional team sports: tempo, balance and  predictability;Sears Merritt, Aaron Clauset;2013/10/16;http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4461v2;Despite growing interest in quantifying and modeling the scoring dynamicswithin professional sports games, relative little is known about what patternsor principles, if any, cut across different sports. Using a comprehensive dataset of scoring events in nearly a dozen consecutive seasons of college andprofessional (American) football, professional hockey, and professionalbasketball, we identify several common patterns in scoring dynamics. Acrossthese sports, scoring tempo---when scoring events occur---closely follows acommon Poisson process, with a sport-specific rate. Similarly, scoringbalance---how often a team wins an event---follows a common Bernoulli process,with a parameter that effectively varies with the size of the lead. Combiningthese processes within a generative model of gameplay, we find they bothreproduce the observed dynamics in all four sports and accurately predict gameoutcomes. These results demonstrate common dynamical patterns underlyingwithin-game scoring dynamics across professional team sports, and suggestspecific mechanisms for driving them. We close with a brief discussion of theimplications of our results for several popular hypotheses about sportsdynamics.

Smith;2013/10/25;http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6998v1;We study the relationship between social media output and National FootballLeague (NFL) games, using a dataset containing messages from Twitter and NFLgame statistics. Specifically, we consider tweets pertaining to specific teamsand games in the NFL season and use them alongside statistical game data tobuild predictive models for future game outcomes (which team will win?) andsports betting outcomes (which team will win with the point spread? will thetotal points be over/under the line?). We experiment with several feature setsand find that simple features using large volumes of tweets can match or exceedthe performance of more traditional features that use game statistics.
ArXiv;The other optimal Stokes drag profile;Thomas D. Montenegro-Johnson, Eric Lauga;2014/11/18;http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4783v1;"The lowest drag shape of fixed volume in Stokes flow has been known for some40 years. It is front-back symmetric and similar to an American football withends tangent to a cone of 60 degrees. The analogous convex axisymmetric shapeof fixed surface area, which may be of interest for particle design inchemistry and colloidal science, is characterized in this paper. This ""other""optimal shape has a surface vorticity proportional to the mean surfacecurvature, which is used with a local analysis of the flow near the tip to showthat the front and rear ends are tangent to a cone of angle 30.8 degrees. Usingthe boundary element method, we numerically represent the shape by expandingits tangent angle in terms decaying odd Legendre modes, and show that it has11.3% lower drag than a sphere of equal surface area, significantly morepronounced than for the fixed-volume optimal."
ArXiv;Direct Prediction of 3D Body Poses from Motion Compensated Sequences;Bugra Tekin, Artem Rozantsev, Vincent Lepetit, Pascal Fua;2015/11/20;http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06692v4;We propose an efficient approach to exploiting motion information fromconsecutive frames of a video sequence to recover the 3D pose of people.Previous approaches typically compute candidate poses in individual frames andthen link them in a post-processing step to resolve ambiguities. By contrast,we directly regress from a spatio-temporal volume of bounding boxes to a 3Dpose in the central frame.  We further show that, for this approach to achieve its full potential, it isessential to compensate for the motion in consecutive frames so that thesubject remains centered. This then allows us to effectively overcomeambiguities and improve upon the state-of-the-art by a large margin on theHuman3.6m, HumanEva, and KTH Multiview Football 3D human pose estimationbenchmarks.

The main challenge lies in the fact thattraditional structural communities do not always capture the intrinsic featuresof metadata groups. Motivated by the observation that metadata groups in PPInetworks tend to consist of an abundance of interacting triad motifs, we definea 2-club substructure with diameter 2 which possessing triad-rich property todescribe a metadata group. Based on the triad-rich substructure, we design aDIVision Algorithm using our proposed edge Niche Centrality DIVANC to detectmetadata groups effectively in complex networks. We also extend DIVANC todetect overlapping metadata groups by proposing a simple 2-hop overlappingstrategy. To verify the effectiveness of triad-rich substructures, we compareDIVANC with existing algorithms on PPI networks, LFR synthetic networks andfootball networks. The experimental results show that DIVANC outperforms mostother algorithms significantly and, in particular, can detect sparse metadatagroups.
ArXiv;Compact Flow Diagrams for State Sequences;Kevin Buchin, Maike Buchin, Joachim Gudmundsson, Michael Horton, Stef Sijben;2016/02/17;http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05622v1;We introduce the concept of compactly representing a large number of statesequences, e.g., sequences of activities, as a flow diagram. We argue that theflow diagram representation gives an intuitive summary that allows the user todetect patterns among large sets of state sequences. Simplified, our aim is togenerate a small flow diagram that models the flow of states of all the statesequences given as input. For a small number of state sequences we presentefficient algorithms to compute a minimal flow diagram. For a large number ofstate sequences we show that it is unlikely that efficient algorithms exist.More specifically, the problem is W[1]-hard if the number of state sequences istaken as a parameter. We thus introduce several heuristics for this problem. Weargue about the usefulness of the flow diagram by applying the algorithms totwo problems in sports analysis. We evaluate the performance of our algorithmson a football data set and generated data.

ArXiv;Analysis of association football playing styles: an innovative method to  cluster networks;Jacopo Diquigiovanni, Bruno Scarpa;2018/05/28;http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10933v2;In this work we develop an innovative hierarchical clustering method todivide a sample of undirected weighted networks into groups. The methodologyconsists of two phases: the first phase is aimed at putting the single networksin a broader framework by including the characteristics of the population inthe data, while the second phase creates a subdivision of the sample on thebasis of the similarity between the community structures of the processednetworks. Starting from the representation of the team's playing style as anetwork, we apply the method to group the Italian Serie A teams' performancesand consequently detect the main 15 tactics shown during the 2015-2016 season.The information obtained is used to verify the effect of the styles of play onthe number of goals scored, and we prove the key role of one of them byimplementing an extension of the Dixon and Coles model (Dixon and Coles, 1997).
ArXiv;Identifying Land Patterns from Satellite Imagery in Amazon Rainforest  using Deep Learning;Somnath Rakshit, Soumyadeep Debnath, Dhiman Mondal;2018/09/02;http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00340v1;The Amazon rainforests have been suffering widespread damage, both vianatural and artificial means. Every minute, it is estimated that the worldloses forest cover the size of 48 football fields. Deforestation in the Amazonrainforest has led to drastically reduced biodiversity, loss of habitat,climate change, and other biological losses. In this respect, it has becomeessential to track how the nature of these forests change over time. Imageclassification using deep learning can help speed up this process by removingthe manual task of classifying each image. Here, it is shown how convolutionalneural networks can be used to track changes in land patterns in the Amazonrainforests. In this work, a testing accuracy of 96.71% was obtained. This canhelp governments and other agencies to track changes in land patterns moreeffectively and accurately.

ArXiv;Jury-Contestant Bipartite Competition Network: Identifying Biased Scores  and Their Impact on Network Structure Inference;Gyuhyeon Jeon, Juyong Park;2016/08/08;http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02326v1;A common form of competition is one where judges grade contestants'performances which are then compiled to determine the final ranking of thecontestants. Unlike in another common form of competition where two contestantsplay a head-to-head match to produce a winner as in football or basketball, theobjectivity of judges are prone to be questioned, potentially undermining thepublic's trust in the fairness of the competition. In this work we show, bymodeling the judge--contestant competition as a weighted bipartite network, howwe can identify biased scores and measure their impact on our inference of thenetwork structure. Analyzing the prestigious International Chopin PianoCompetition of 2015 with a well-publicized scoring controversy as an example,we show that even a single statistically uncharacteristic score can be enoughto gravely distort our inference of the community structure, demonstrating theimportance of detecting and eliminating biases. In the process we also findthat there does not exist a significant system-wide bias of the judges based onthe the race of the contestants.

ArXiv;UEFA Champions League entry has not satisfied strategyproofness in three  seasons;László Csató;2018/01/20;http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06644v5;The paper investigates the qualification for the UEFA Champions League, themost prestigious club competition in European football with respect to thetheoretical property of strategy-proofness. We find that in three seasons(2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18), the UEFA Europa League titleholder might have beenbetter off by losing its match against the Champions League titleholder intheir domestic championship. A straightforward solution is suggested in orderto avoid the occurrence of this paradox. The use of an incentive compatiblerule would have a real effect on the qualification in these three seasons ofthe UEFA Champions League.
ArXiv;Route Identification in the National Football League;Dani Chu, Matthew Reyers, James Thomson, Lucas Wu;2019/08/07;http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02423v1;Tracking data in the NFL is a sequence of spatial-temporal measurements thatvary in length depending on the duration of the play. In this paper, wedemonstrate how model-based curve clustering of observed player trajectoriescan be used to identify the routes run by eligible receivers on offensivepassing plays. We use a Bernstein polynomial basis function to representcluster centers, and the Expectation Maximization algorithm to learn the routelabels for each of the 34,698 routes run on the 6,963 passing plays in the dataset. We go on to suggest ideas for new potential receiver metrics that accountfor receiver deployment. The resulting route labels can also be paired withfilm to enable streamlined queries of game film.
ArXiv;Understanding and Pushing the Limits of the Elo Rating Algorithm;Leszek Szczecinski, Aymen Djebbi;2019/10/02;http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06081v1;This work is concerned with the rating of players/teams in face-to-face gameswith three possible outcomes: loss, win, and draw. This is one of thefundamental problems in sport analytics, where the very simple and popular,non-trivial algorithm was proposed by Arpad Elo in late fifties to rate chessplayers. In this work we explain the mathematical model underlying the Eloalgorithm and, in particular, we explain what is the implicit but not yetspelled out, assumption about the model of draws. We further extend the modelto provide flexibility and remove the unrealistic implicit assumptions of theElo algorithm. This yields the new rating algorithm, we call $\kappa$-Elo,which is equally simple as the Elo algorithm but provides a possibility toadjust to the frequency of draws. The discussion of the importance of theappropriate choice of the parameters is carried out and illustrated usingresults from English Premier League football seasons.
ArXiv;Bayesian Hierarchical Models for the Prediction of Volleyball Results;Andrea Gabrio;2019/11/20;http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08791v1;Statistical modelling of sports data has become more and more popular in therecent years and different types of models have been proposed to achieve avariety of objectives: from identifying the key characteristics which lead ateam to win or lose to predicting the outcome of a game or the team rankings innational leagues. Although not as popular as football or basketball, volleyballis a team sport with both national and international level competitions inalmost every country. However, there is almost no study investigating theprediction of volleyball game outcomes and team rankings in national leagues.We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model for the prediction of the rankings ofvolleyball national teams, which also allows to estimate the results of eachmatch in the league. We consider two alternative model specifications ofdifferent complexity which are validated using data from the women's volleyballItalian Serie A1 2017-2018 season.
ArXiv;On the Graph Laplacian and the Rankability of Data;Thomas R. Cameron, Amy N. Langville, Heather C. Smith;2019/11/30;http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00275v1;Recently, Anderson et al. (2019) proposed the concept of rankability, whichrefers to a dataset's inherent ability to produce a meaningful ranking of itsitems. In the same paper, they proposed a rankability measure that is based ona integer program for computing the minimum number of edge changes made to adirected graph in order to obtain a complete dominance graph, i.e., an acyclictournament graph. In this article, we prove a spectral-degree characterizationof complete dominance graphs and apply this characterization to produce a newmeasure of rankability that is cost-effective and more widely applicable. Wesupport the details of our algorithm with several results regarding theconditioning of the Laplacian spectrum of complete dominance graphs and theHausdorff distance between their Laplacian spectrum and that of an arbitrarydirected graph with weights between zero and one. Finally, we analyze therankability of datasets from the world of chess and college football.
ArXiv;Neighborhood Cognition Consistent Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning;Hangyu Mao, Wulong Liu, Jianye Hao, Jun Luo, Dong Li, Zhengchao Zhang, Jun Wang, Zhen Xiao;2019/12/03;http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01160v2;Social psychology and real experiences show that cognitive consistency playsan important role to keep human society in order: if people have a moreconsistent cognition about their environments, they are more likely to achievebetter cooperation. Meanwhile, only cognitive consistency within a neighborhoodmatters because humans only interact directly with their neighbors. Inspired bythese observations, we take the first step to introduce \emph{neighborhoodcognitive consistency} (NCC) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).Our NCC design is quite general and can be easily combined with existing MARLmethods. As examples, we propose neighborhood cognition consistent deepQ-learning and Actor-Critic to facilitate large-scale multi-agent cooperations.Extensive experiments on several challenging tasks (i.e., packet routing, wificonfiguration, and Google football player control) justify the superiorperformance of our methods compared with state-of-the-art MARL approaches.
ArXiv;Multi-stream Data Analytics for Enhanced Performance Prediction in  Fantasy Football;Nicholas Bonello, Joeran Beel, Seamus Lawless, Jeremy Debattista;2019/12/16;http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07441v1;Fantasy Premier League (FPL) performance predictors tend to base theiralgorithms purely on historical statistical data. The main problems with thisapproach is that external factors such as injuries, managerial decisions andother tournament match statistics can never be factored into the finalpredictions. In this paper, we present a new method for predicting futureplayer performances by automatically incorporating human feedback into ourmodel. Through statistical data analysis such as previous performances,upcoming fixture difficulty ratings, betting market analysis, opinions of thegeneral-public and experts alike via social media and web articles, we canimprove our understanding of who is likely to perform well in upcoming matches.When tested on the English Premier League 2018/19 season, the modeloutperformed regular statistical predictors by over 300 points, an average of11 points per week, ranking within the top 0.5% of players rank 30,000 out ofover 6.5 million players.
ArXiv;Soft Q Network;Jingbin Liu, Shuai Liu, Xinyang Gu;2019/12/20;http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10891v2;Deep Q Network (DQN) is a very successful algorithm, yet the inherent problemof reinforcement learning, i.e. the exploit-explore balance, remains. In thiswork, we introduce entropy regularization into DQN and propose SQN. We findthat the backup equation of soft Q learning can enjoy the corrective feedbackif we view the soft backup as policy improvement in the form of Q, instead ofpolicy evaluation. We show that Soft Q Learning with Corrective Feedback(SQL-CF) underlies the on-plicy nature of SQL and the equivalence of SQL andSoft Policy Gradient (SPG). With these insights, we propose an on-policyversion of deep Q learning algorithm, i.e. Q On-Policy (QOP). We experimentwith QOP on a self-play environment called Google Research Football (GRF). TheQOP algorithm exhibits great stability and efficiency in training GRF agents.
ArXiv;Accumulator Bet Selection Through Stochastic Diffusion Search;Nassim Dehouche;2020/04/18;http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08607v1;An accumulator is a bet that presents a rather unique payout structure, inthat it combines multiple bets into a wager that can generate a total payoutgiven by the multiplication of the individual odds of its parts. Thesepotentially important returns come however at an increased risk of a loss.Indeed, the presence of a single incorrect bet in this selection would make thewhole accumulator lose. The complexity of selecting a set of matches to placean accumulator bet on, as well as the number of opportunities to identifywinning combinations have both dramatically increased with the easier access toonline and offline bookmakers that bettors have nowadays. We address thisrelatively under-studied combinatorial aspect of sports betting, and propose abinary optimization model for the problem of selecting the most promisingcombinations of matches, in terms of their total potential payout andprobability of a win, to form an accumulator bet. The results of an ongoingcomputational experiment, in which our model is applied to real data pertainingto the four main football leagues in the world over a complete season, arepresented and compared to those of single bet selection methods.
ArXiv;Identification of skill in an online game: The case of Fantasy Premier  League;Joseph D. O'Brien, James P. Gleeson, David J. P. O'Sullivan;2020/09/02;http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01206v1;In all competitions where results are based upon an individual's performancethe question of whether the outcome is a consequence of skill or luck arises.We explore this question through an analysis of a large dataset ofapproximately one million contestants playing Fantasy Premier League, an onlinefantasy sport where managers choose players from the English football (soccer)league. We show that managers' ranks over multiple seasons are correlated andwe analyse the actions taken by managers to increase their likelihood ofsuccess. The prime factors in determining a manager's success are found to belong-term planning and consistently good decision-making in the face of thenoisy contests upon which this game is based. Similarities between managers'decisions over time that result in the emergence of 'template' teams,suggesting a form of herding dynamics taking place within the game, are alsoobserved. Taken together, these findings indicate common strategicconsiderations and consensus among successful managers on crucial decisionpoints over an extended temporal period.
ArXiv;A paradox of tournament seeding;László Csató;2020/11/23;http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11277v6;We analyse a mathematical model of seeding for sports contests withround-robin qualifying tournaments. The standard seeding system based oncoefficients measuring the historical performance of the teams is shown to beunfair as it might potentially punish a team for its better results by havingto face stronger opponents on average in the next stage. Major footballcompetitions are revealed to suffer from this weakness. Incentive compatibilitycan be guaranteed by providing each qualified team with the highest coefficientof all teams that are ranked lower in its qualifying tournament for seedingpurposes. Our proposal is illustrated by the 2020/21 UEFA Champions League.
ArXiv;High-Throughput Synchronous Deep RL;Iou-Jen Liu, Raymond A. Yeh, Alexander G. Schwing;2020/12/17;http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09849v1;Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is computationally demanding and requiresprocessing of many data points. Synchronous methods enjoy training stabilitywhile having lower data throughput. In contrast, asynchronous methods achievehigh throughput but suffer from stability issues and lower sample efficiencydue to `stale policies.' To combine the advantages of both methods we proposeHigh-Throughput Synchronous Deep Reinforcement Learning (HTS-RL). In HTS-RL, weperform learning and rollouts concurrently, devise a system design which avoids`stale policies' and ensure that actors interact with environment replicas inan asynchronous manner while maintaining full determinism. We evaluate ourapproach on Atari games and the Google Research Football environment. Comparedto synchronous baselines, HTS-RL is 2-6$\times$ faster. Compared tostate-of-the-art asynchronous methods, HTS-RL has competitive throughput andconsistently achieves higher average episode rewards.

Deep neural network algorithms, as a powerfulengine, can handle this problem if they are trained over an appropriatedataset. To this end, the football keyword dataset (FKD), as a new keywordspotting dataset in Persian, is collected with crowdsourcing. This datasetcontains nearly 31000 samples in 18 classes. The continuous speech synthesismethod proposed to made FKD usable in the practical application which workswith continuous speeches. Besides, we proposed a lightweight architecturecalled EfficientNet-A0 (absolute zero) by applying the compound scaling methodon EfficientNet-B0 for keyword spotting task. Finally, the proposedarchitecture is evaluated with various models. It is realized thatEfficientNet-A0 and Resnet models outperform other models on this dataset.
ArXiv;ROBustness In Network (robin): an R package for Comparison and  Validation of communities;Valeria Policastro, Dario Righelli, Annamaria Carissimo, Luisa Cutillo, Italia De Feis;2021/02/05;http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03106v1;In network analysis, many community detection algorithms have been developed,however, their implementation leaves unaddressed the question of thestatistical validation of the results. Here we present robin(ROBustness InNetwork), an R package to assess the robustness of the community structure of anetwork found by one or more methods to give indications about theirreliability. The procedure initially detects if the community structure foundby a set of algorithms is statistically significant and then compares twoselected detection algorithms on the same graph to choose the one that betterfits the network of interest. We demonstrate the use of our package on theAmerican College Football benchmark dataset.
ArXiv;Locational Marginal Pricing: Towards a Free Market in Power;Martin Higgins;2021/03/05;http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10937v1;Nothing has done more to empower the free market, enterprise, and meritocracythan the spread of electricity and power to everyone. The power system has beenthe precursor to the greatest period of innovation in our history and has meantthat visionaries with revolutionary ideas can compete with those with capital,political power, and means. Electricity, therefore, has been the greatequalising force of the last 150 years, enhancing the productivity of themasses and granting prosperity to whole swathes of our nation. Whilstelectricity has been one of the single largest innovations in enhancing thepower of free markets, it is somewhat ironic that the way power is sold toconsumers is largely unfree. The market is highly regulated, centralised, andis often used for political football by cynical politicians on both sides ofthe political spectrum. Introducing Locational Marginal Pricing into the UKgrid system will increase economic freedom in the consumer markets for power,reduce prices for the poorest in the UK, decrease transmission losses, increasethe permeation of low carbon generation in the grid, and incentivise investmentin the UK's Northern Powerhouse initiative.
ArXiv;Agent-Centric Representations for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning;Wenling Shang, Lasse Espeholt, Anton Raichuk, Tim Salimans;2021/04/19;http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09402v1;Object-centric representations have recently enabled significant progress intackling relational reasoning tasks. By building a strong object-centricinductive bias into neural architectures, recent efforts have improvedgeneralization and data efficiency of machine learning algorithms for theseproblems. One problem class involving relational reasoning that still remainsunder-explored is multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Here weinvestigate whether object-centric representations are also beneficial in thefully cooperative MARL setting. Specifically, we study two ways ofincorporating an agent-centric inductive bias into our RL algorithm: 1.Introducing an agent-centric attention module with explicit connections acrossagents 2. Adding an agent-centric unsupervised predictive objective (i.e. notusing action labels), to be used as an auxiliary loss for MARL, or as the basisof a pre-training step. We evaluate these approaches on the Google ResearchFootball environment as well as DeepMind Lab 2D. Empirically, agent-centricrepresentation learning leads to the emergence of more complex cooperationstrategies between agents as well as enhanced sample efficiency andgeneralization.
ArXiv;Elo Ratings for Large Tournaments of Software Agents in Asymmetric Games;Ben Wise;2021/04/23;http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00839v1;The Elo rating system has been used world wide for individual sports and teamsports, as exemplified by the European Go Federation (EGF), International ChessFederation (FIDE), International Federation of Association Football (FIFA), andmany others. To evaluate the performance of artificial intelligence agents, itis natural to evaluate them on the same Elo scale as humans, such as the ratingof 5185 attributed to AlphaGo Zero.  There are several fundamental differences between humans and AI that suggestmodifications to the system, which in turn require revisiting Elo's fundamentalrationale. AI is typically trained on many more games than humans play, and wehave little a-priori information on newly created AI agents. Further, AI isbeing extended into games which are asymmetric between the players, and whichcould even have large complex boards with different setup in every game, suchas commercial paper strategy games. We present a revised rating system, andguidelines for tournaments, to reflect these differences.
ArXiv;Poisson Modeling and Predicting English Premier League Goal Scoring;Quang Nguyen;2021/05/20;http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09881v2;"The English Premier League is well-known for being not only one of the mostpopular professional sports leagues in the world, but also one of the toughestcompetitions to predict. The first purpose of this research was to verify theconsistency between goal scoring in the English Premier League and the Poissonprocess; specifically, the relationships between the number of goals scored ina match and the Poisson distribution, the time between goals throughout thecourse of a season and the exponential distribution, and the time location ofgoals during football games and the continuous uniform distribution. We foundthat the Poisson process and the three probability distributions accuratelydescribe Premier League goal scoring. In addition, Poisson regression wasutilized to predict outcomes for a Premier League season, using different setsof season data and with a large number of simulations being involved. Weexamined and compared various soccer metrics from our simulation results,including an English club's chances of being the champions, finishing in thetop four and bottom three, and relegation points."
ArXiv;The Earth Mover's Pinball Loss: Quantiles for Histogram-Valued  Regression;Florian List;2021/06/03;http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02051v1;Although ubiquitous in the sciences, histogram data have not received muchattention by the Deep Learning community. Whilst regression and classificationtasks for scalar and vector data are routinely solved by neural networks, aprincipled approach for estimating histogram labels as a function of an inputvector or image is lacking in the literature. We present a dedicated method forDeep Learning-based histogram regression, which incorporates cross-bininformation and yields distributions over possible histograms, expressed by$\tau$-quantiles of the cumulative histogram in each bin. The crux of ourapproach is a new loss function obtained by applying the pinball loss to thecumulative histogram, which for 1D histograms reduces to the Earth Mover'sdistance (EMD) in the special case of the median ($\tau = 0.5$), andgeneralizes it to arbitrary quantiles. We validate our method with anillustrative toy example, a football-related task, and an astrophysicalcomputer vision problem. We show that with our loss function, the accuracy ofthe predicted median histograms is very similar to the standard EMD case (andhigher than for per-bin loss functions such as cross-entropy), while thepredictions become much more informative at almost no additional computationalcost.
ArXiv;Celebrating Diversity in Shared Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning;Chenghao Li, Tonghan Wang, Chengjie Wu, Qianchuan Zhao, Jun Yang, Chongjie Zhang;2021/06/04;http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02195v2;Recently, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown thepromise to solve complex cooperative tasks. Its success is partly because ofparameter sharing among agents. However, such sharing may lead agents to behavesimilarly and limit their coordination capacity. In this paper, we aim tointroduce diversity in both optimization and representation of sharedmulti-agent reinforcement learning. Specifically, we propose aninformation-theoretical regularization to maximize the mutual informationbetween agents' identities and their trajectories, encouraging extensiveexploration and diverse individualized behaviors. In representation, weincorporate agent-specific modules in the shared neural network architecture,which are regularized by L1-norm to promote learning sharing among agents whilekeeping necessary diversity. Empirical results show that our method achievesstate-of-the-art performance on Google Research Football and super hardStarCraft II micromanagement tasks.
ArXiv;HieRec: Hierarchical User Interest Modeling for Personalized News  Recommendation;Tao Qi, Fangzhao Wu, Chuhan Wu, Peiru Yang, Yang Yu, Xing Xie, Yongfeng Huang;2021/06/08;http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04408v1;"User interest modeling is critical for personalized news recommendation.Existing news recommendation methods usually learn a single user embedding foreach user from their previous behaviors to represent their overall interest.However, user interest is usually diverse and multi-grained, which is difficultto be accurately modeled by a single user embedding. In this paper, we proposea news recommendation method with hierarchical user interest modeling, namedHieRec. Instead of a single user embedding, in our method each user isrepresented in a hierarchical interest tree to better capture their diverse andmulti-grained interest in news. We use a three-level hierarchy to represent 1)overall user interest; 2) user interest in coarse-grained topics like sports;and 3) user interest in fine-grained topics like football. Moreover, we proposea hierarchical user interest matching framework to match candidate news withdifferent levels of user interest for more accurate user interest targeting.Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets validate our method caneffectively improve the performance of user modeling for personalized newsrecommendation."

ArXiv;MimicBot: Combining Imitation and Reinforcement Learning to win in Bot  Bowl;Nicola Pezzotti;2021/08/21;http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09478v1;This paper describe an hybrid agent trained to play in Fantasy Football AIwhich participated in the Bot Bowl III competition. The agent, MimicBot, isimplemented using a specifically designed deep policy network and trained usinga combination of imitation and reinforcement learning. Previous attempts inusing a reinforcement learning approach in such context failed for a number ofreasons, e.g. due to the intrinsic randomness in the environment and the largeand uneven number of actions available, with a curriculum learning approachfailing to consistently beat a randomly paying agent. Currently no machinelearning approach can beat a scripted bot which makes use of the domainknowledge on the game. Our solution, thanks to an imitation learning and ahybrid decision-making process, consistently beat such scripted agents.Moreover we shed lights on how to more efficiently train in a reinforcementlearning setting while drastically increasing sample efficiency. MimicBot isthe winner of the Bot Bowl III competition, and it is currently thestate-of-the-art solution.
ArXiv;Fairer group draw for sports tournaments with restrictions;László Csató;2021/09/28;http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13785v4;Some recent sports tournaments establish restrictions in the draw of thegroup stage. In this case, the mechanism used by the Union of European FootballAssociations (UEFA) to assign the teams into groups is unevenly distributedsince not all valid allocations are equally likely. It is shown by illustrativeexamples how a careful choice of the pot labels and randomisation in the sizeof the groups can reduce that unfairness. According to our Monte Carlosimulations, the draw of the European Qualifiers to the 2022 FIFA World Cupcould have been closer to uniform distribution without any negative effects.Our recommendation has a good chance to be implemented in practice.
ArXiv;Learning Multi-agent Action Coordination via Electing First-move Agent;Jingqing Ruan, Linghui Meng, Xuantang Xiong, Dengpeng Xing, Bo Xu;2021/09/20;http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08126v3;Learning to coordinate actions among agents is essential in complicatedmulti-agent systems. Prior works are constrained mainly by the assumption thatall agents act simultaneously, and asynchronous action coordination betweenagents is rarely considered. This paper introduces a bi-level multi-agentdecision hierarchy for coordinated behavior planning. We propose a novelelection mechanism in which we adopt a graph convolutional network to model theinteraction among agents and elect a first-move agent for asynchronousguidance. We also propose a dynamically weighted mixing network to effectivelyreduce the misestimation of the value function during training. This work isthe first to explicitly model the asynchronous multi-agent action coordination,and this explicitness enables to choose the optimal first-move agent. Theresults on Cooperative Navigation and Google Football demonstrate that theproposed algorithm can achieve superior performance in cooperativeenvironments.

ArXiv;Containerized Distributed Value-Based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning;Siyang Wu, Tonghan Wang, Chenghao Li, Yang Hu, Chongjie Zhang;2021/10/15;http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08169v2;Multi-agent reinforcement learning tasks put a high demand on the volume oftraining samples. Different from its single-agent counterpart, distributedvalue-based multi-agent reinforcement learning faces the unique challenges ofdemanding data transfer, inter-process communication management, and highrequirement of exploration. We propose a containerized learning framework tosolve these problems. We pack several environment instances, a local learnerand buffer, and a carefully designed multi-queue manager which avoids blockinginto a container. Local policies of each container are encouraged to be asdiverse as possible, and only trajectories with highest priority are sent to aglobal learner. In this way, we achieve a scalable, time-efficient, and diversedistributed MARL learning framework with high system throughput. To ownknowledge, our method is the first to solve the challenging Google ResearchFootball full game $5\_v\_5$. On the StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark,our method gets $4$-$18\times$ better results compared to state-of-the-artnon-distributed MARL algorithms.
ArXiv;The effects of draw restrictions on knockout tournaments;László Csató;2021/10/26;http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13641v5;The paper analyses how draw constraints influence the outcome of a knockouttournament. The research question is inspired by European club footballcompetitions, where the organiser generally imposes an association constraintin the first round of the knockout phase: teams from the same country cannot bedrawn against each other. Its effects are explored in both theoretical andsimulation models. An association constraint in the first round(s) is found toincrease the likelihood of same nation matchups to approximately the sameextent in each subsequent round. If the favourite teams are concentrated insome associations, they will have a higher probability to win the tournamentunder this policy but the increase is less than linear if it is used in morerounds. Our results might explain the recent introduction of the associationconstraint for both the knockout round play-offs with 16 teams and the Round of16 in the UEFA Europa League and UEFA Europa Conference League.
ArXiv;Eguchi--Hanson metrics arising from Kahler--Einstein edge metrics;Yuxiang Ji, Yanir A. Rubinstein, Kewei Zhang;2021/11/01;http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00652v2;Calabi--Hirzebruch manifolds are higher-dimensional generalizations of boththe football and Hirzebruch surfaces. We construct a family of Kahler--Einsteinedge metrics singular along two disjoint divisors on the Calabi--Hirzebruchmanifolds and study their Gromov--Hausdorff limits when either cone angle tendsto its extreme value. As a very special case, we show that the celebratedEguchi--Hanson metric arises in this way naturally as a Gromov--Hausdorfflimit. We also completely describe all other (possibly rescaled)Gromov--Hausdorff limits which exhibit a wide range of behaviors, resolving inthis setting a conjecture of Cheltsov--Rubinstein. This gives a newinterpretation of both the Eguchi--Hanson space and Calabi's Ricci flat spacesas limits of compact singular Einstein spaces.

ArXiv;On the role of tournament design in sporting success: A study of the  North, Central American and Caribbean qualification for the 2022 FIFA World  Cup;László Csató;2021/10/12;http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03435v1;Playing in the FIFA World Cup finals is an ambition shared by severalnations. Since, besides luck and skill, the probability of qualificationdepends on the design of the qualifiers, the study of these competitions formsan integral part of sports analytics. The Confederation of North, CentralAmerica and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) announced a novelqualifying format for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in July 2019. However, theCOVID-19 pandemic forced the organisers to return to a more traditionalstructure. The present chapter analyses how this reform impacted the chances ofthe national teams to qualify. It is found that the probability ofparticipating in the FIFA World Cup finals can change by more than 5 percentagepoints under the assumption of fixed strengths for the teams. The idea behindthe original design, to divide the contestants into two distinct sets, is worthconsidering due to the increased competitiveness of the matches played by thestrongest and the weakest teams. We recommend mitigating the sharp nonlinearitycaused by the seeding policy via a probabilistic rule to the analogy of the NBAdraft lottery system.
ArXiv;GCS: Graph-based Coordination Strategy for Multi-Agent Reinforcement  Learning;Jingqing Ruan, Yali Du, Xuantang Xiong, Dengpeng Xing, Xiyun Li, Linghui Meng, Haifeng Zhang, Jun Wang, Bo Xu;2022/01/17;http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06257v1;Many real-world scenarios involve a team of agents that have to coordinatetheir policies to achieve a shared goal. Previous studies mainly focus ondecentralized control to maximize a common reward and barely consider thecoordination among control policies, which is critical in dynamic andcomplicated environments. In this work, we propose factorizing the joint teampolicy into a graph generator and graph-based coordinated policy to enablecoordinated behaviours among agents. The graph generator adopts anencoder-decoder framework that outputs directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) tocapture the underlying dynamic decision structure. We also apply theDAGness-constrained and DAG depth-constrained optimization in the graphgenerator to balance efficiency and performance. The graph-based coordinatedpolicy exploits the generated decision structure. The graph generator andcoordinated policy are trained simultaneously to maximize the discountedreturn. Empirical evaluations on Collaborative Gaussian Squeeze, CooperativeNavigation, and Google Research Football demonstrate the superiority of theproposed method.
ArXiv;Transfer Portal: Accurately Forecasting the Impact of a Player Transfer  in Soccer;Daniel Dinsdale, Joe Gallagher;2022/01/27;http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11533v1;One of the most important and challenging problems in football is predictingfuture player performance when transferred to another club within and betweendifferent leagues. In addition to being the most valuable prediction a teammakes, it is also the most complex analytics task to perform as it needs totake into consideration: a) differences in playing style between the player'scurrent team and target team, b) differences in style and ability of otherplayers on each team, c) differences in league quality and style, and d) therole the player is desired to play. In this paper, we present a method whichaddresses these issues and enables us to make accurate predictions of futureperformance. Our Transfer Portal model utilizes a personalized neural networkaccounting for both stylistic and ability level input representations forplayers, teams, and leagues to simulate future player performance at any chosenclub. Furthermore, we use a Bayesian updating framework to dynamically modifyplayer and team representations over time which enables us to generatepredictions for rising stars with small amounts of data.
ArXiv;Knock, knock. Who's there? -- Identifying football player jersey numbers  with synthetic data;Divya Bhargavi, Erika Pelaez Coyotl, Sia Gholami;2022/03/01;http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00734v2;Automatic player identification is an essential and complex task in sportsvideo analysis. Different strategies have been devised over the years, butidentification based on jersey numbers is one of the most common approachesgiven its versatility and relative simplicity. However, automatic detection ofjersey numbers is still challenging due to changing camera angles, low videoresolution, small object size in wide-range shots and transient changes in theplayer's posture and movement. In this paper we present a novel approach forjersey number identification in a small, highly imbalanced dataset from theSeattle Seahawks practice videos. Our results indicate that simple models canachieve an acceptable performance on the jersey number detection task and thatsynthetic data can improve the performance dramatically (accuracy increase of~9% overall, ~18% on low frequency numbers) making our approach achieve stateof the art results.
ArXiv;UEFA EURO 2020: a pure game of chance?;Giulia Fedrizzi, Luisa Canal, Rocco Micciolo;2022/03/14;http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07531v1;"We analysed the distribution of the number of goals scored in each of the 51football matches played in the UEFA EURO 2020 final phase as well as thewaiting times between scores (also considering censored times). We found thatthe Poisson model fits the score data and the exponential distribution fitswaiting times quite well. Such a good fit could be considered somewhatcounterintuitive and unrealistic given the memoryless property of theexponential model. However, some peculiar features of this study have to beconsidered: the abilities of the teams were relatively homogeneous; the timespan was short; there was no distinction between home and away games; only thetotal number of goals scored in each game was considered. Although UEFA EURO2020 can certainly not be considered a ""pure game of chance"", this competitioncan be seen as an intriguing example of the pervasive real-world ubiquity ofthe concept of independence and its ability to encompass complex situations ina single, parsimonious model."
ArXiv;Nested Zero Inflated Generalized Poisson Regression for FIFA World Cup  2022;Lorenz A. Gilch;2022/05/09;http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04173v3;This article is devoted to the forecast of the FIFA World Cup 2022 via nestedzero-inflated generalized Poisson regression. Our regression model incorporatesthe Elo points of the participating teams, the location of the matches and theof team-specific skills in attack and defense as covariates. The proposed modelallows predictions in terms of probabilities in order to quantify the chancesfor each team to reach a certain stage of the tournament. We use Monte Carlosimulations for estimating the outcome of each single match of the tournament,from which we are able to simulate the whole tournament itself. The model isfitted on all football games of the participating teams since 2016 weighted bydate and importance. Validation with previous tournaments and comparison withother Poisson models are given.

This trade-off has led to the emergence ofeXplainable AI (XAI). XAI attempts to shed light on how models use predictorsto arrive at a prediction with local explanations, a point estimate of thelinear feature importance in the vicinity of one instance. These can beconsidered linear projections and can be further explored to understand betterthe interactions between features used to make predictions across thepredictive model surface. Here we describe interactive linear interpolationused for exploration at any instance and illustrate with examples withcategorical (penguin species, chocolate types) and quantitative(soccer/football salaries, house prices) output. The methods are implemented inthe R package cheem, available on CRAN.
ArXiv;Preventing collusion created by tie-breaking rules;László Csató;2022/06/08;http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03961v3;Games played in the last round of a round-robin tournament inspirematch-fixing or tacit collusion if the two opposing teams can benefit from aparticular result at the expense of other teams. In the case of four teams, thecurrent study identifies all these situations caused by using head-to-headrecords as the primary tie-breaking principle. Simulations based on the 2016UEFA European Football Championship reveal that the official tie-breakingpolicy substantially increases the risk of collusion, but it can be mitigatedby choosing an optimal order of matches. Following the proposed scheduleimproves the competitiveness of the two games played in the last round andrequires no reform on the format of the competition.

For this sub-challenge, we first build a discriminantmodel using the transformer module and BiLSTM module, and then propose a hybridfusion strategy to use the prediction results of each modality to improve theperformance of the model. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ourproposed model and hybrid fusion strategy on multimodal fusion, and the AUC ofour proposed model on the test set is 0.8972.
ArXiv;PTDE: Personalized Training with Distillated Execution for Multi-Agent  Reinforcement Learning;Yiqun Chen, Hangyu Mao, Tianle Zhang, Shiguang Wu, Bin Zhang, Jianye Hao, Dong Li, Bin Wang, Hongxing Chang;2022/10/17;http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08872v1;Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has been a verypopular paradigm for multi-agent reinforcement learning. One of its mainfeatures is making full use of the global information to learn a better joint$Q$-function or centralized critic. In this paper, we in turn explore how toleverage the global information to directly learn a better individual$Q$-function or individual actor. We find that applying the same globalinformation to all agents indiscriminately is not enough for good performance,and thus propose to specify the global information for each agent to obtainagent-specific global information for better performance. Furthermore, wedistill such agent-specific global information into the agent's localinformation, which is used during decentralized execution without too muchperformance degradation. We call this new paradigm Personalized Training withDistillated Execution (PTDE). PTDE can be easily combined with manystate-of-the-art algorithms to further improve their performance, which isverified in both SMAC and Google Research Football scenarios.

Robust RL has been applied to deal with taskambiguity, but may result in over-conservative policies. To balance theworst-case (robustness) and average performance, we propose GroupDistributionally Robust Markov Decision Process (GDR-MDP), a flexiblehierarchical MDP formulation that encodes task groups via a latent mixturemodel. GDR-MDP identifies the optimal policy that maximizes the expected returnunder the worst-possible qualified belief over task groups within an ambiguityset. We rigorously show that GDR-MDP's hierarchical structure improvesdistributional robustness by adding regularization to the worst possibleoutcomes. We then develop deep RL algorithms for GDR-MDP for both value-basedand policy-based RL methods. Extensive experiments on Box2D control tasks,MuJoCo benchmarks, and Google football platforms show that our algorithmsoutperform classic robust training algorithms across diverse environments interms of robustness under belief uncertainties. Demos are available on ourproject page (\url{https://sites.google.com/view/gdr-rl/home}).

ArXiv;Teacher-student curriculum learning for reinforcement learning;Yanick Schraner;2022/10/31;http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17368v1;Reinforcement learning (rl) is a popular paradigm for sequential decisionmaking problems. The past decade's advances in rl have led to breakthroughs inmany challenging domains such as video games, board games, robotics, and chipdesign. The sample inefficiency of deep reinforcement learning methods is asignificant obstacle when applying rl to real-world problems. Transfer learninghas been applied to reinforcement learning such that the knowledge gained inone task can be applied when training in a new task. Curriculum learning isconcerned with sequencing tasks or data samples such that knowledge can betransferred between those tasks to learn a target task that would otherwise betoo difficult to solve. Designing a curriculum that improves sample efficiencyis a complex problem. In this thesis, we propose a teacher-student curriculumlearning setting where we simultaneously train a teacher that selects tasks forthe student while the student learns how to solve the selected task. Our methodis independent of human domain knowledge and manual curriculum design. Weevaluated our methods on two reinforcement learning benchmarks: grid world andthe challenging Google Football environment. With our method, we can improvethe sample efficiency and generality of the student compared to tabula-rasareinforcement learning.
ArXiv;Graph-Based Multi-Camera Soccer Player Tracker;Jacek Komorowski, Grzegorz Kurzejamski;2022/11/03;http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02125v1;The paper presents a multi-camera tracking method intended for trackingsoccer players in long shot video recordings from multiple calibrated camerasinstalled around the playing field. The large distance to the camera makes itdifficult to visually distinguish individual players, which adversely affectsthe performance of traditional solutions relying on the appearance of trackedobjects. Our method focuses on individual player dynamics and interactionsbetween neighborhood players to improve tracking performance. To overcome thedifficulty of reliably merging detections from multiple cameras in the presenceof calibration errors, we propose the novel tracking approach, where thetracker operates directly on raw detection heat maps from multiple cameras. Ourmodel is trained on a large synthetic dataset generated using Google ResearchFootball Environment and fine-tuned using real-world data to reduce costsinvolved with ground truth preparation.

Using a high-frequency datasetprovided directly by a major bookmaker, containing the odds and amounts stakedthroughout German Bundesliga football matches, we test for evidence of momentumin the betting and pricing behaviour after equalising goals. We find thatbettors see value in teams that have the apparent momentum, staking about 40%more on them than teams that just conceded an equaliser. Still, there is noevidence that such perceived momentum matters on average for match outcomes oris associated with the bookmaker offering favourable odds. We also confirm thatbetting on the apparent momentum would lead to substantial losses for bettors.
ArXiv;Axion Free-kick Misalignment Mechanism;Ling-Xiao Xu, Seokhoon Yun;2022/11/23;http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13074v1;We propose an alternative scenario of axion misalignment mechanism based onnontrivial interplay between axion and a light dilaton in the early universe.Dark matter abundance is still sourced by the initial misalignment of axionfield, whose motion along the potential kicks the dilaton field away from itsminimum, and dilaton starts to oscillate later with a delayed onset time foroscillation and a relatively large misalignment value due to kick, eventuallythe dilaton dominates over axion in their energy densities and dilaton isidentified as dark matter. The kick effect due to axion motion is the mostsignificant if the initial field value of dilaton is near its minimum,therefore we call this scenario axion free-kick misalignment mechanism, whereaxion plays the role similar to a football player. Dark matter abundance can beobtained with a lower axion decay constant compared to the conventionalmisalignment mechanism.
ArXiv;Hierarchical Strategies for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement  Learning;Majd Ibrahim, Ammar Fayad;2022/12/14;http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07397v1;Adequate strategizing of agents behaviors is essential to solving cooperativeMARL problems. One intuitively beneficial yet uncommon method in this domain ispredicting agents future behaviors and planning accordingly. Leveraging thispoint, we propose a two-level hierarchical architecture that combines a novelinformation-theoretic objective with a trajectory prediction model to learn astrategy. To this end, we introduce a latent policy that learns two types oflatent strategies: individual $z_A$, and relational $z_R$ using a modifiedGraph Attention Network module to extract interaction features. We encourageeach agent to behave according to the strategy by conditioning its local $Q$functions on $z_A$, and we further equip agents with a shared $Q$ function thatconditions on $z_R$. Additionally, we introduce two regularizers to allowpredicted trajectories to be accurate and rewarding. Empirical results onGoogle Research Football (GRF) and StarCraft (SC) II micromanagement tasks showthat our method establishes a new state of the art being, to the best of ourknowledge, the first MARL algorithm to solve all super hard SC II scenarios aswell as the GRF full game with a win rate higher than $95\%$, thusoutperforming all existing methods.

ArXiv;Instant Replay: Investigating statistical Analysis in Sports;Gagan Sidhu;2011/02/27;http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.5549v4;Technology has had an unquestionable impact on the way people watch sports.Along with this technological evolution has come a higher standard to ensure agood viewing experience for the casual sports fan. It can be argued that thepervasion of statistical analysis in sports serves to satiate the fan's desirefor detailed sports statistics. The goal of statistical analysis in sports is asimple one: to eliminate subjective analysis. In this paper, we review previouswork that attempts to analyze various aspects in sports by using ideas fromMarkov Chains, Bayesian Inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.The unifying goal of these works is to achieve an accurate representation ofthe player's ability, the sport, or the environmental effects on the player'sperformance. With the prevalence of cheap computation, it is possible thatusing techniques in Artificial Intelligence could improve the result ofstatistical analysis in sport. This is best illustrated when evaluatingfootball using Neuro Dynamic Programming, a Control Theory paradigm heavilybased on theory in Stochastic processes. The results from this method suggestthat statistical analysis in sports may benefit from using ideas from the areaof Control Theory or Machine Learning
ArXiv;Assessing the consistency of community structure in complex networks;Matthew Steen, Satoru Hayasaka, Karen Joyce, Paul Laurienti;2011/05/31;http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0041v3;In recent years, community structure has emerged as a key component ofcomplex network analysis. As more data has been collected, researchers havebegun investigating changing community structure across multiple networks.Several methods exist to analyze changing communities, but most of these arelimited to evolution of a single network over time. In addition, most of theexisting methods are more concerned with change at the community level than atthe level of the individual node. In this paper, we introduce scaledinclusivity, which is a method to quantify the change in community structureacross networks. Scaled inclusivity evaluates the consistency of theclassiffication of every node in a network independently. In addition, themethod can be applied cross-sectionally as well as longitudinally. In thispaper, we calculate the scaled inclusivity for a set of simulated networks ofUnited States cities and a set of real networks consisting of teams that playin the top division of American college football. We found that scaledinclusivity yields reasonable results for the consistency of individual nodesin both sets of networks. We propose that scaled inclusivity may provide auseful way to quantify the change in a network's community structure.
ArXiv;Scoring Strategies for the Underdog: A general, quantitative method for  determining optimal sports strategies;Brian Skinner;2011/11/02;http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.0693v1;When facing a heavily-favored opponent, an underdog must be willing to assumegreater-than-average risk. In statistical language, one would say that anunderdog must be willing to adopt a strategy whose outcome has alarger-than-average variance. The difficult question is how much risk a teamshould be willing to accept. This is equivalent to asking how much the teamshould be willing to sacrifice from its mean score in order to increase thescore's variance. In this paper a general, analytical method is developed foraddressing this question quantitatively. Under the assumption that every playin a game is statistically independent, both the mean and the variance of ateam's offensive output can be described using the binomial distribution. Thisdescription allows for direct calculations of the winning probability when aparticular strategy is employed, and therefore allows one to calculate optimaloffensive strategies. This paper develops this method for calculating optimalstrategies exactly and then presents a simple heuristic for determining whethera given strategy should be adopted. A number of interesting andcounterintuitive examples are then explored, including the merits of stallingfor time, the run/pass/Hail Mary choice in American football, and the correctuse of Hack-a-Shaq.

ArXiv;Multi-Level Anomaly Detection on Time-Varying Graph Data;Robert A. Bridges, John Collins, Erik M. Ferragut, Jason Laska, Blair D. Sullivan;2014/10/16;http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.4355v4;This work presents a novel modeling and analysis framework for graphsequences which addresses the challenge of detecting and contextualizinganomalies in labelled, streaming graph data. We introduce a generalization ofthe BTER model of Seshadhri et al. by adding flexibility to communitystructure, and use this model to perform multi-scale graph anomaly detection.Specifically, probability models describing coarse subgraphs are built byaggregating probabilities at finer levels, and these closely relatedhierarchical models simultaneously detect deviations from expectation. Thistechnique provides insight into a graph's structure and internal context thatmay shed light on a detected event. Additionally, this multi-scale analysisfacilitates intuitive visualizations by allowing users to narrow focus from ananomalous graph to particular subgraphs or nodes causing the anomaly.  For evaluation, two hierarchical anomaly detectors are tested against abaseline Gaussian method on a series of sampled graphs. We demonstrate that ourgraph statistics-based approach outperforms both a distribution-based detectorand the baseline in a labeled setting with community structure, and itaccurately detects anomalies in synthetic and real-world datasets at the node,subgraph, and graph levels. To illustrate the accessibility of information madepossible via this technique, the anomaly detector and an associated interactivevisualization tool are tested on NCAA football data, where teams andconferences that moved within the league are identified with perfect recall,and precision greater than 0.786.

State-of-the-art effortscontinue to rely on empirical, scalar metrics based on kinematics ormodel-estimated tissue responses explicitly pre-defined in a specific brainregion of interest. They could suffer from loss of information. A singletraining dataset has also been used to evaluate performance but withoutcross-validation. In this study, we developed a deep learning approach forconcussion classification using implicit features of the entire voxel-wisewhite matter fiber strains. Using reconstructed American National FootballLeague (NFL) injury cases, leave-one-out cross-validation was employed toobjectively compare injury prediction performances against two baseline machinelearning classifiers (support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)) andfour scalar metrics via univariate logistic regression (Brain Injury Criterion(BrIC), cumulative strain damage measure of the whole brain (CSDM-WB) and thecorpus callosum (CSDM-CC), and peak fiber strain in the CC). Feature-based deeplearning and machine learning classifiers consistently outperformed all scalarinjury metrics across all performance categories in cross-validation (e.g.,average accuracy of 0.844 vs. 0.746, and average area under the receiveroperating curve (AUC) of 0.873 vs. 0.769, respectively, based on the testingdataset). Nevertheless, deep learning achieved the best cross-validationaccuracy, sensitivity, and AUC (e.g., accuracy of 0.862 vs. 0.828 and 0.842 forSVM and RF, respectively). These findings demonstrate the superior performancesof deep learning in concussion prediction, and suggest its promise for futureapplications in biomechanical investigations of traumatic brain injury.

In this paper, we study how general-purposeontologies---specifically, MIT's ConceptNet ontology---can improve theperformance of state-of-the-art vision systems. As a testbed, we tackle theproblem of sentence-based image retrieval. Our retrieval approach incorporatesknowledge from ConceptNet on top of a large pool of object detectors derivedfrom a deep learning technique. In our experiments, we show that ConceptNet canimprove performance on a common benchmark dataset. Key to our performance isthe use of the ESPGAME dataset to select visually relevant relations fromConceptNet. Consequently, a main conclusion of this work is thatgeneral-purpose commonsense ontologies improve performance on visual reasoningtasks when properly filtered to select meaningful visual relations."
ArXiv;Community Detection by $L_0$-penalized Graph Laplacian;Chong Chen, Ruibin Xi, Nan Lin;2017/06/30;http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.10273v1;Community detection in network analysis aims at partitioning nodes in anetwork into $K$ disjoint communities. Most currently available algorithmsassume that $K$ is known, but choosing a correct $K$ is generally verydifficult for real networks. In addition, many real networks contain outliernodes not belonging to any community, but currently very few algorithm canhandle networks with outliers. In this paper, we propose a novel model freetightness criterion and an efficient algorithm to maximize this criterion forcommunity detection. This tightness criterion is closely related with the graphLaplacian with $L_0$ penalty. Unlike most community detection methods, ourmethod does not require a known $K$ and can properly detect communities innetworks with outliers.  Both theoretical and numerical properties of the method are analyzed. Thetheoretical result guarantees that, under the degree corrected stochastic blockmodel, even for networks with outliers, the maximizer of the tightnesscriterion can extract communities with small misclassification rates even whenthe number of communities grows to infinity as the network size grows.Simulation study shows that the proposed method can recover true communitiesmore accurately than other methods. Applications to a college football data anda yeast protein-protein interaction data also reveal that the proposed methodperforms significantly better.
ArXiv;Ordered community structure in networks;Steve Gregory;2011/04/05;http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0923v3;Community structure in networks is often a consequence of homophily, orassortative mixing, based on some attribute of the vertices. For example,researchers may be grouped into communities corresponding to their researchtopic. This is possible if vertex attributes have discrete values, but manynetworks exhibit assortative mixing by some continuous-valued attribute, suchas age or geographical location. In such cases, no discrete communities can beidentified. We consider how the notion of community structure can begeneralized to networks that are based on continuous-valued attributes: ingeneral, a network may contain discrete communities which are ordered accordingto their attribute values. We propose a method of generating synthetic orderednetworks and investigate the effect of ordered community structure on thespread of infectious diseases. We also show that community detection algorithmsfail to recover community structure in ordered networks, and evaluate analternative method using a layout algorithm to recover the ordering.
ArXiv;When neither team wants to win: a flaw of recent UEFA qualification  rules;László Csató;2018/06/22;http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08578v8;Tanking, the act of deliberately dropping points or losing a game in order togain some other advantage, is usually seen as being against the spirit ofsports. It can be even more serious if playing a draw is a (weakly) dominantstrategy for both teams in a match, since this may lead to collusion. We showthat such a situation occurred in a particular football match. As ourgeneralisation reveals, the root of the problem resides in the incentiveincompatibility of certain UEFA qualification rules. The governing bodies ofmajor sports should choose strategy-proof tournament designs because of severalreasons. First, they may lead to the elimination of a third, innocent team.Second, incentive incompatible rules may discourage both teams from scoringgoals, and the players could be interested in improving other match statisticsthan the number of goals.
ArXiv;Fair tournament design: A flaw of the UEFA Euro 2020 qualification;László Csató;2019/05/08;http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03325v6;The integrity of a sport can be seriously undermined if its rules punishwinning as this creates incentives for strategic manipulation. Therefore, asports tournament can be called unfair if the overall win probabilities are notordered according to the teams' ranking based on their past performances. Wepresent how statistical methods can contribute to choosing a tournament formatthat is in line with the above axiom. In particular, the qualification for the2020 UEFA European Championship is shown to violate this requirement: being atop team in the lowest-ranked League D of the 2018/19 UEFA Nations Leaguesubstantially increases the probability of qualifying compared to being abottom team in the higher-ranked League C. The unfairness can be remarkablyreduced or even eliminated with slightly changing the path formation policy ofthe UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying play-offs. The misaligned design has severelypunished a team for winning a match years before. Since the deficiency is aninherent feature of the qualifying process, the Union of European FootballAssociations (UEFA) should reconsider the format of future tournaments toeliminate the unfair advantage enjoyed by certain teams.
ArXiv;A Bayesian Approach to In-Game Win Probability in Soccer;Pieter Robberechts, Jan Van Haaren, Jesse Davis;2019/06/12;http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05029v2;In-game win probability models, which provide a sports team's likelihood ofwinning at each point in a game based on historical observations, are becomingincreasingly popular. In baseball, basketball and American football, they havebecome important tools to enhance fan experience, to evaluate in-gamedecision-making, and to inform coaching decisions. While equally relevant insoccer, the adoption of these models is held back by technical challengesarising from the low-scoring nature of the sport.  In this paper, we introduce an in-game win probability model for soccer thataddresses the shortcomings of existing models. First, we demonstrate thatin-game win probability models for other sports struggle to provide accurateestimates for soccer, especially towards the end of a game. Second, weintroduce a novel Bayesian statistical framework that estimates running win,tie and loss probabilities by leveraging a set of contextual game statefeatures. An empirical evaluation on eight seasons of data for the top-fivesoccer leagues demonstrates that our framework provides well-calibratedprobabilities.

Osher;2012/07/26;http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.6430v2;Given a graph where vertices represent alternatives and arcs representpairwise comparison data, the statistical ranking problem is to find apotential function, defined on the vertices, such that the gradient of thepotential function agrees with the pairwise comparisons. Our goal in this paperis to develop a method for collecting data for which the least squaresestimator for the ranking problem has maximal Fisher information. Our approach,based on experimental design, is to view data collection as a bi-leveloptimization problem where the inner problem is the ranking problem and theouter problem is to identify data which maximizes the informativeness of theranking. Under certain assumptions, the data collection problem decouples,reducing to a problem of finding multigraphs with large algebraic connectivity.This reduction of the data collection problem to graph-theoretic questions isone of the primary contributions of this work. As an application, we study theYahoo! Movie user rating dataset and demonstrate that the addition of a smallnumber of well-chosen pairwise comparisons can significantly increase theFisher informativeness of the ranking. As another application, we study the2011-12 NCAA football schedule and propose schedules with the same number ofgames which are significantly more informative. Using spectral clusteringmethods to identify highly-connected communities within the division, we arguethat the NCAA could improve its notoriously poor rankings by simply schedulingmore out-of-conference games.
ArXiv;TwitterPaul: Extracting and Aggregating Twitter Predictions;Naushad UzZaman, Roi Blanco, Michael Matthews;2012/11/28;http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.6496v2;This paper introduces TwitterPaul, a system designed to make use of SocialMedia data to help to predict game outcomes for the 2010 FIFA World Cuptournament. To this end, we extracted over 538K mentions to football games froma large sample of tweets that occurred during the World Cup, and we classifiedinto different types with a precision of up to 88%. The different mentions wereaggregated in order to make predictions about the outcomes of the actual games.We attempt to learn which Twitter users are accurate predictors and exploreseveral techniques in order to exploit this information to make more accuratepredictions. We compare our results to strong baselines and against the bettingline (prediction market) and found that the quality of extractions is moreimportant than the quantity, suggesting that high precision methods working ona medium-sized dataset are preferable over low precision methods that use alarger amount of data. Finally, by aggregating some classes of predictions, thesystem performance is close to the one of the betting line. Furthermore, webelieve that this domain independent framework can help to predict othersports, elections, product release dates and other future events that peopletalk about in social media.
ArXiv;SFA Referee Allocation Scheme;Nikolaos Polatidis;2014/08/28;http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6661v1;For many sports, the allocation of officials to matches is performed manuallyand is a very time consuming procedure. For the Scottish Football Association(SFA), the allocation of referees and other officials to matches is governed bya number of rules specifying the expertise required from the different types ofofficial at each level, e.g. Scottish Premiership League referee must be agrade 1 with high experience. The allocation requires an SFA secretary toexpend several hours to find suitable officials, contact them and assign them.Most of the time, the secretary is a volunteer who performs the allocation as ahobby and it would be useful to reduce his costs and time.  The project aims to reduce the burden on SFA, and potentially othersecretaries, by developing a program to assign SFA officials. A suitablealgorithm must be devised to search through the set of data about matches andofficials and find a potential allocation. The program then updates thedatabase with the new data, and provides a web interface for both secretariesand officials.  A prototype system using the new greedy algorithm has been implemented andevaluated with SFA secretaries. A final usable referee allocation system hasbeen designed that uses the greedy algorithm, and is extended after evaluationof the prototype. The final allocation system based provides both a commandline and a web interface and has also been evaluated by SFA secretaries. Intheir letters of recommendation in Appendix F the SFA secretaries indicate thatthe final allocation system it will be used again in the future.
ArXiv;This House Proves that Debating is Harder than Soccer;Stefan Neumann, Andreas Wiese;2016/05/10;http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03063v1;During the last twenty years, a lot of research was conducted on the sportelimination problem: Given a sports league and its remaining matches, we haveto decide whether a given team can still possibly win the competition, i.e.,place first in the league at the end. Previously, the computational complexityof this problem was investigated only for games with two participating teamsper game. In this paper we consider Debating Tournaments and Debating Leaguesin the British Parliamentary format, where four teams are participating in eachgame. We prove that it is NP-hard to decide whether a given team can win aDebating League, even if at most two matches are remaining for each team. Thiscontrasts settings like football where two teams play in each game since therethis case is still polynomial time solvable. We prove our result even for afictitious restricted setting with only three teams per game. On the otherhand, for the common setting of Debating Tournaments we show that this problemis fixed parameter tractable if the parameter is the number of remaining rounds$k$. This also holds for the practically very important question of whether ateam can still qualify for the knock-out phase of the tournament and thecombined parameter $k + b$ where $b$ denotes the threshold rank for qualifying.Finally, we show that the latter problem is polynomial time solvable for anyconstant $k$ and arbitrary values $b$ that are part of the input.
ArXiv;Top dense hyperbolic ball packings and coverings for complete Coxeter  orthoscheme groups;Emil Molnár, Jenő Szirmai;2016/12/14;http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04541v1;"In $n$-dimensional hyperbolic space $\mathbf{H}^n$ $(n\ge2)$ there are$3$-types of spheres (balls): the sphere, horosphere and hypersphere. If$n=2,3$ we know an universal upper bound of the ball packing densities, whereeach ball volume is related to the volume of the correspondingDirichlet-Voronoi (D-V) cell. E.g. in $\mathbf{H}^3$ the densest horoballpacking is derived from the $\{3,3,6\}$ Coxeter tiling consisting of idealregular simplices $T_{reg}^\infty$ with dihedral angles $\frac{\pi}{3}$. Thedensity of this packing is $\delta_3^\infty\approx 0.85328$ and this provides avery rough upper bound for the ball packing densities as well. However, thereare no ""essential"" results regarding the ""classical"" ball packings withcongruent balls, and for ball coverings either.  The goal of this paper to find the extremal ball arrangements in$\mathbf{H}^3$ with ""classical balls"". We consider only periodic congruent ballarrangements (for simplicity) related to the generalized, so-called {\itcomplete Coxeter orthoschemes} and their extended groups. In Theorems 1.1-1.2we formulate also conjectures for the densest ball packing with density$0.77147\dots$ and the loosest ball covering with density $1.36893\dots$,respectively. Both are related with the extended Coxeter group $(5, 3, 5)$ andthe so-called hyperbolic football manifold (look at Fig.~3). These facts canhave important relations with fullerens in crystallography."
ArXiv;How often does the best team win? A unified approach to understanding  randomness in North American sport;Michael J. Lopez, Gregory J. Matthews, Benjamin S. Baumer;2017/01/21;http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05976v3;Statistical applications in sports have long centered on how to best separatesignal (e.g. team talent) from random noise. However, most of this work hasconcentrated on a single sport, and the development of meaningful cross-sportcomparisons has been impeded by the difficulty of translating luck from onesport to another. In this manuscript, we develop Bayesian state-space modelsusing betting market data that can be uniformly applied across sportingorganizations to better understand the role of randomness in game outcomes.These models can be used to extract estimates of team strength, thebetween-season, within-season, and game-to-game variability of team strengths,as well each team's home advantage. We implement our approach across a decadeof play in each of the National Football League (NFL), National Hockey League(NHL), National Basketball Association (NBA), and Major League Baseball (MLB),finding that the NBA demonstrates both the largest dispersion in talent and thelargest home advantage, while the NHL and MLB stand out for their relativerandomness in game outcomes. We conclude by proposing new metrics for judgingcompetitiveness across sports leagues, both within the regular season and usingtraditional postseason tournament formats. Although we focus on sports, wediscuss a number of other situations in which our generalizable models might beusefully applied.

However, a lot ofattention has been focused on each coach's individual features. A systematicand quantitative analysis of the whole coach hiring market is lacking. In acoach hiring network, the coaches are actually voting with their feet. It isinteresting to analyze what factors are affecting the ""footprint"" left by thosehead coaches. In this paper, we collect more than 12,000 head coach hiringrecords in two different popular sports from the NCAA. Using network-basedmethods, we build the coach hiring network in the NCAA men's basketball andfootball. We find that: (1).the coach hiring network is of great inequality incoach production with a Gini coefficient close to 0.60. (2).coaches prefer towork within the same geographical region and the same division to their almamaters'. (3).the coach production rankings we calculated using network-basedmethods are generally correlated to the authoritative rankings, but also showdisaccord in specific time period. The results provide us a novel view andbetter understanding of the coach hiring market in the NCAA and shed new lighton the coach hiring system."

We show that while inappropriate for sentences,dictionary-based methods are generally robust in their classification accuracyfor longer texts.  Stories often following distinct emotional trajectories, forming patternsthat are meaningful to us. By classifying the emotional arcs for a filteredsubset of 4,803 stories from Project Gutenberg's fiction collection, we find aset of six core trajectories which form the building blocks of complexnarratives. Of profound scientific interest will be the degree to which we caneventually understand the full landscape of human stories, and data drivenapproaches will play a crucial role.

Neural Fictitious Self Play (NFSP) isan effective algorithm for learning approximate Nash equilibrium ofimperfect-information games from self-play without prior domain knowledge.However, it relies on Deep Q-Network, which is off-line and is hard to convergein online games with changing opponent strategy, so it can't approachapproximate Nash equilibrium in games with large search scale and deep searchdepth. In this paper, we propose Monte Carlo Neural Fictitious Self Play(MC-NFSP), an algorithm combines Monte Carlo tree search with NFSP, whichgreatly improves the performance on large-scale zero-sum imperfect-informationgames. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the proposed Monte Carlo NeuralFictitious Self Play can converge to approximate Nash equilibrium in games withlarge-scale search depth while the Neural Fictitious Self Play can't.Furthermore, we develop Asynchronous Neural Fictitious Self Play (ANFSP). Ituse asynchronous and parallel architecture to collect game experience. Inexperiments, we show that parallel actor-learners have a further acceleratedand stabilizing effect on training.
ArXiv;Promoting Coordination through Policy Regularization in Multi-Agent Deep  Reinforcement Learning;Julien Roy, Paul Barde, Félix G. Harvey, Derek Nowrouzezahrai, Christopher Pal;2019/08/06;http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02269v4;In multi-agent reinforcement learning, discovering successful collectivebehaviors is challenging as it requires exploring a joint action space thatgrows exponentially with the number of agents. While the tractability ofindependent agent-wise exploration is appealing, this approach fails on tasksthat require elaborate group strategies. We argue that coordinating the agents'policies can guide their exploration and we investigate techniques to promotesuch an inductive bias. We propose two policy regularization methods: TeamReg,which is based on inter-agent action predictability and CoachReg that relies onsynchronized behavior selection. We evaluate each approach on four challengingcontinuous control tasks with sparse rewards that require varying levels ofcoordination as well as on the discrete action Google Research Footballenvironment. Our experiments show improved performance across many cooperativemulti-agent problems. Finally, we analyze the effects of our proposed methodson the policies that our agents learn and show that our methods successfullyenforce the qualities that we propose as proxies for coordinated behaviors.
ArXiv;Time Series Modeling for Dream Team in Fantasy Premier League;Akhil Gupta;2019/09/19;http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12938v1;The performance of football players in English Premier League varies largelyfrom season to season and for different teams. It is evident that a methodcapable of forecasting and analyzing the future of these players on-fieldantics shall assist the management to a great extent. In a simulatedenvironment like the Fantasy Premier League, enthusiasts from all over theworld participate and manage the players catalogue for the entire season. Dueto the dynamic nature of points system, there is no known approach for theformulation of a dream team. This study aims to tackle this problem by using ahybrid of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Recurrent NeuralNetworks (RNNs) for time series prediction of player points and subsequentmaximization of total points using Linear Programming (LPP). Given the playerpoints for the past three seasons, the predictions have been made for thecurrent season by modeling differently for ARIMA and RNN, and then creating anensemble of the same. Prior to that, proper data preprocessing techniques weredeployed to enhance the efficacy of the prepared model. Constraints on the typeof players like goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders and forwards along with thetotal budget were effectively optimized using LPP approach. The validation ofthe proposed team was done with the performance in upcoming season, where theplayers outperform as expected, and helped in strengthening the feasibility ofthe solution. Likewise, the proposed approach can be extended to EnglishPremier League by official managers on-field.
ArXiv;Cosmic footballs from superrotations;Eugene Adjei, William Donnelly, Victor Py, Antony J. Speranza;2019/10/11;http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05435v1;Superrotations arise from singular vector fields on the celestial sphere inasymptotically flat space, and their finite integrated versions have beenargued by Strominger and Zhiboedov to insert cosmic strings into the spacetime.In this work, we argue for an alternative definition of the action ofsuperrotations on Minkowski space that avoids introducing any defects. Thisinvolves realizing the finite superrotation not as a diffeomorphism betweenspaces, but as a mapping of Minkowski space to itself that may be multivaluedor non-surjective. This eliminates any defects in the bulk spacetime at theexpense of allowing for defects in the boundary celestial sphere metric. Wefurther explore the geometry of the spatial surfaces in the superrotatedspaces, and note that they intersect null infinity at the singularity of thesuperrotation, causing a breakdown in the large $r$ asymptotic expansion there.To determine how these surfaces embed into Minkowski space, a derivation of thefinite superrotation transformation is presented in both Bondi and Newman-Untigauges. The latter is particularly interesting, since the superrotations areshown to preserve the hyperbolic slicing of Minkowski space in Newman-Untigauge, and this gauge also provides a means for extending the geometry beyondthe Bondi coordinate patch. We argue that the new interpretation for the actionof superrotations on spacetime motivates consideration of a wider class ofcelestial sphere metrics and asymptotic symmetry groups.
ArXiv;Expected Hypothetical Completion Probability;Sameer K. Deshpande, Katherine Evans;2019/10/27;http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12337v1;"Using high-resolution player tracking data made available by the NationalFootball League (NFL) for their 2019 Big Data Bowl competition, we introducethe Expected Hypothetical Completion Probability (EHCP), a objective frameworkfor evaluating plays. At the heart of EHCP is the question ""on a given passingplay, did the quarterback throw the pass to the receiver who was most likely tocatch it?"" To answer this question, we first built a Bayesian non-parametriccatch probability model that automatically accounts for complex interactionsbetween inputs like the receiver's speed and distances to the ball and nearestdefender. While building such a model is, in principle, straightforward, usingit to reason about a hypothetical pass is challenging because many of the modelinputs corresponding to a hypothetical are necessarily unobserved. To wit, itis impossible to observe how close an un-targeted receiver would be to hisnearest defender had the pass been thrown to him instead of the receiver whowas actually targeted. To overcome this fundamental difficulty, we proposeimputing the unobservable inputs and averaging our model predictions acrossthese imputations to derive EHCP. In this way, EHCP can track how thecompletion probability evolves for each receiver over the course of a play in away that accounts for the uncertainty about missing inputs."
ArXiv;Jump balls, rating falls, and elite status: A sensitivity analysis of  three quarterback rating statistics;Laura A. Albert, John N. Angelis;2019/10/16;http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13347v1;Quarterback performance can be difficult to rank, and much effort has beenspent in creating new rating systems. However, the input statistics for suchratings are subject to randomness and factors outside the quarterback'scontrol. To investigate this variance, we perform a sensitivity analysis ofthree quarterback rating statistics: the Traditional 1971 rating by Smith, theBurke, and the Wages of Wins ratings. The comparisons are made at the teamlevel for the 32 NFL teams from 2002-2015, thus giving each case an even 16games. We compute quarterback ratings for each offense with 1-5 additionaltouchdowns, 1-5 fewer interceptions, 1-5 additional sacks, and a 1-5 percentincrease in the passing completion rate. Our sensitivity analysis providesinsight into whether an elite passing team could seem mediocre or vice versabased on random outcomes. The results indicate that the Traditional rating isthe most sensitive statistic with respect to touchdowns, interceptions, andcompletions, whereas the Burke rating is most sensitive to sacks. The analysissuggests that team passing offense rankings are highly sensitive to aspects offootball that are out of the quarterback's hands (e.g., deflected passes thatlead to interceptions). Thus, on the margins, we show arguments about whether aspecific quarterback has entered the elite or remains mediocre are irrelevant.
ArXiv;Bayesian models for prediction of the set-difference in volleyball;Ioannis Ntzoufras, Vasilis Palaskas, Sotiris Drikos;2019/11/11;http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04541v5;The aim of this paper is to study and develop Bayesian models for theanalysis of volleyball match outcomes as recorded by the set-difference. Due tothe peculiarity of the outcome variable (set-difference) which takes discretevalues from $-3$ to $3$, we cannot consider standard models based on the usualPoisson or binomial assumptions used for other sports such as football/soccer.Hence, the first and foremost challenge was to build models appropriate for theset-differences of each volleyball match. Here we consider two majorapproaches:  a) an ordered multinomial logistic regression model and  b) a model based on a truncated version of the Skellam distribution.  For the first model, we consider the set-difference as an ordinal responsevariable within the framework of multinomial logistic regression models.Concerning the second model, we adjust the Skellam distribution in order toaccount for the volleyball rules. We fit and compare both models with the samecovariate structure as in Karlis & Ntzoufras (2003). Both models are fitted,illustrated and compared within Bayesian framework using data from both theregular season and the play-offs of the season 2016/17 of the Greek nationalmen's volleyball league A1.

The paper evaluates the impact ofthe only reform in the Champions Path of the qualifying system since 2009,effective from the 2018/19 season. While it is anticipated that the reductionin the number of berths decreases the probability of advancing to the groupstage, the distribution of the effects among the national associations isrevealed here via Monte-Carlo simulations. In contrast to previous studies, ourmethodology considers five seasons instead of only one to filter out anypossible season-specific attributes. Almost all countries are found to gainless prize money on average. Several champions, including the Bulgarian, theScottish, and, especially, the Swiss, might lose million Euros. As theconsequences depend to a large extent on the arbitrary cutoffs in the accesslist, we propose to introduce some randomness into the determination of entrystages in the qualification.

ArXiv;Generalizing Cross-Document Event Coreference Resolution Across Multiple  Corpora;Michael Bugert, Nils Reimers, Iryna Gurevych;2020/11/24;http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12249v2;Cross-document event coreference resolution (CDCR) is an NLP task in whichmentions of events need to be identified and clustered throughout a collectionof documents. CDCR aims to benefit downstream multi-document applications, butdespite recent progress on corpora and system development, downstreamimprovements from applying CDCR have not been shown yet. We make theobservation that every CDCR system to date was developed, trained, and testedonly on a single respective corpus. This raises strong concerns on theirgeneralizability -- a must-have for downstream applications where the magnitudeof domains or event mentions is likely to exceed those found in a curatedcorpus. To investigate this assumption, we define a uniform evaluation setupinvolving three CDCR corpora: ECB+, the Gun Violence Corpus and the FootballCoreference Corpus (which we reannotate on token level to make our analysispossible). We compare a corpus-independent, feature-based system against arecent neural system developed for ECB+. Whilst being inferior in absolutenumbers, the feature-based system shows more consistent performance across allcorpora whereas the neural system is hit-and-miss. Via model introspection, wefind that the importance of event actions, event time, etc. for resolvingcoreference in practice varies greatly between the corpora. Additional analysisshows that several systems overfit on the structure of the ECB+ corpus. Weconclude with recommendations on how to achieve generally applicable CDCRsystems in the future -- the most important being that evaluation on multipleCDCR corpora is strongly necessary. To facilitate future research, we releaseour dataset, annotation guidelines, and system implementation to the public.
ArXiv;Data-driven Analysis for Understanding Team Sports Behaviors;Keisuke Fujii;2021/02/15;http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07545v2;Understanding the principles of real-world biological multi-agent behaviorsis a current challenge in various scientific and engineering fields. The rulesregarding the real-world biological multi-agent behaviors such as team sportsare often largely unknown due to their inherently higher-order interactions,cognition, and body dynamics. Estimation of the rules from data, i.e.,data-driven approaches such as machine learning, provides an effective way forthe analysis of such behaviors. Although most data-driven models havenon-linear structures and high prediction performances, it is sometimes hard tointerpret them. This survey focuses on data-driven analysis for quantitativeunderstanding of invasion team sports behaviors such as basketball andfootball, and introduces two main approaches for understanding such multi-agentbehaviors: (1) extracting easily interpretable features or rules from data and(2) generating and controlling behaviors in visually-understandable ways. Thefirst approach involves the visualization of learned representations and theextraction of mathematical structures behind the behaviors. The second approachcan be used to test hypotheses by simulating and controlling future andcounterfactual behaviors. Lastly, the potential practical applications ofextracted rules, features, and generated behaviors are discussed. Theseapproaches can contribute to a better understanding of multi-agent behaviors inthe real world.
ArXiv;The Soccer Game, bit by bit: An information-theoretic analysis;Luis Ramada Pereira, Rui J. Lopes, Jorge Louçã, Duarte Araújo, João Ramos;2021/02/22;http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11182v4;We modeled the dynamics of a soccer match based on a network representationwhere players are nodes discretely clustered into homogeneous groups. Playerswere grouped by physical proximity, supported by the intuitive notion thatcompeting and same-team players use relative position as a key tactical tool tocontribute to the team's objectives. The model was applied to a set of matchesfrom a major European national football league, with players' coordinatessampled at 10Hz, resulting in approx. 60,000 network samples per match. We tookan information theoretic approach to measuring distance between samples andused it as a proxy for the game dynamics. Significant correlations were foundbetween measurements and key match events that are empirically known to resultin players jostling for position, such as when striving to get unmarked or tomark. These events increase the information distance, while breaks in game playhave the opposite effect. By analyzing the frequency spectrum of players'cluster transitions and their corresponding information distance, it ispossible to build a comprehensive view of player's interactions, useful fortraining and strategy development. This analysis can be drilled down to thelevel of individual players by quantifying their contribution to clusterbreakup and emergence, building an overall multi-level map that providesinsights into the game dynamics, from the individual player, to the clusters ofinteracting players, all the way to the teams and their matches.
ArXiv;The Surprising Effectiveness of PPO in Cooperative, Multi-Agent Games;Chao Yu, Akash Velu, Eugene Vinitsky, Jiaxuan Gao, Yu Wang, Alexandre Bayen, Yi Wu;2021/03/02;http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01955v4;Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a ubiquitous on-policy reinforcementlearning algorithm but is significantly less utilized than off-policy learningalgorithms in multi-agent settings. This is often due to the belief that PPO issignificantly less sample efficient than off-policy methods in multi-agentsystems. In this work, we carefully study the performance of PPO in cooperativemulti-agent settings. We show that PPO-based multi-agent algorithms achievesurprisingly strong performance in four popular multi-agent testbeds: theparticle-world environments, the StarCraft multi-agent challenge, GoogleResearch Football, and the Hanabi challenge, with minimal hyperparameter tuningand without any domain-specific algorithmic modifications or architectures.Importantly, compared to competitive off-policy methods, PPO often achievescompetitive or superior results in both final returns and sample efficiency.Finally, through ablation studies, we analyze implementation and hyperparameterfactors that are critical to PPO's empirical performance, and give concretepractical suggestions regarding these factors. Our results show that when usingthese practices, simple PPO-based methods can be a strong baseline incooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning.

ArXiv;On the fairness of the restricted group draw in the 2018 FIFA World Cup;László Csató;2021/03/21;http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11353v6;Several sports tournaments contain a round-robin group stage where the teamsare assigned to groups subject to some constraints. Since finding an allocationof the teams that satisfies the established criteria is non-trivial, theorganisers use a computer-assisted random draw to avoid any dead end, asituation when the teams still to be drawn cannot be assigned to the remainingempty slots. It is shown how this mechanism is connected to systematicallygenerate all permutations of a given sequence, a well-known problem in computerscience. We quantify the departure of the 2018 FIFA World Cup draw procedurefrom an evenly distributed random choice among all feasible allocations andevaluate its effect on the probability of qualification for the knockout stagefor each nation. The draw order of Pot 1, Pot 2, Pot 4, Pot 3 turns out to be abetter option than the official rule (Pot 1, Pot 2, Pot 3, Pot 4) with respectto these unwanted distortions. Governing bodies in football are encouraged tomake similar calculations before the draw of major sporting events in order tofind an optimal draw order by appropriate labelling of the pots.

Here we propose a simple model that describes thedynamics around peaks of popularity by incorporating key features, i.e., theanticipatory growth and the decay of collective attention together withcircadian rhythms. The proposed model allows us to develop a new method forpredicting the future page view activity and for clustering time series. Tovalidate our methodology, we collect a corpus of page view data from Wikipediaassociated to a range of planned events, that are events which we know inadvance will have a fixed date in the future, such as elections and sportevents. Our methodology is superior to existing models in both prediction andclustering tasks. Furthermore, restricting to Wikipedia pages associated toassociation football, we observe that the specific realization of the event, inour case which team wins a match or the type of the match, has a significanteffect on the response dynamics after the event. Our work demonstrates theimportance of appropriately modeling all phases of collective attention, aswell as the connection between temporal patterns of attention andcharacteristic underlying information of the events they represent.
ArXiv;Multivariate Conway-Maxwell-Poisson Distribution: Sarmanov Method and  Doubly-Intractable Bayesian Inference;Luiza S. C. Piancastelli, Nial Friel, Wagner Barreto-Souza, Hernando Ombao;2021/07/15;http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07561v1;"In this paper, a multivariate count distribution with Conway-Maxwell(COM)-Poisson marginals is proposed. To do this, we develop a modification ofthe Sarmanov method for constructing multivariate distributions. Ourmultivariate COM-Poisson (MultCOMP) model has desirable features such as (i) itadmits a flexible covariance matrix allowing for both negative and positivenon-diagonal entries; (ii) it overcomes the limitation of the existingbivariate COM-Poisson distributions in the literature that do not haveCOM-Poisson marginals; (iii) it allows for the analysis of multivariate countsand is not just limited to bivariate counts. Inferential challenges arepresented by the likelihood specification as it depends on a number ofintractable normalizing constants involving the model parameters. Theseobstacles motivate us to propose a Bayesian inferential approach where theresulting doubly-intractable posterior is dealt with via the exchange algorithmand the Grouped Independence Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Numericalexperiments based on simulations are presented to illustrate the proposedBayesian approach. We analyze the potential of the MultCOMP model through areal data application on the numbers of goals scored by the home and away teamsin the Premier League from 2018 to 2021. Here, our interest is to assess theeffect of a lack of crowds during the COVID-19 pandemic on the well-known hometeam advantage. A MultCOMP model fit shows that there is evidence of adecreased number of goals scored by the home team, not accompanied by a reducedscore from the opponent. Hence, our analysis suggests a smaller home teamadvantage in the absence of crowds, which agrees with the opinion of severalfootball experts."
ArXiv;Assessing competitive balance in the English Premier League for over  forty seasons using a stochastic block model;Francesca Basini, Vasiliki Tsouli, Ioannis Ntzoufras, Nial Friel;2021/07/19;http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08732v1;Competitive balance is a desirable feature in any professional sports leagueand encapsulates the notion that there is unpredictability in the outcome ofgames as opposed to an imbalanced league in which the outcome of some games aremore predictable than others, for example, when an apparent strong team playsagainst a weak team. In this paper, we develop a model-based clusteringapproach to provide an assessment of the balance between teams in a league. Wepropose a novel Bayesian model to represent the results of a football season asa dense network with nodes identified by teams and categorical edgesrepresenting the outcome of each game. The resulting stochastic block modelfacilitates the probabilistic clustering of teams to assess whether there arecompetitive imbalances in a league. A key question then is to assess theuncertainty around the number of clusters or blocks and consequently estimationof the partition or allocation of teams to blocks. To do this, we develop anMCMC algorithm that allows the joint estimation of the number of blocks and theallocation of teams to blocks. We apply our model to each season in the Englishpremier league from $1978/79$ to $2019/20$. A key finding of this analysis isevidence which suggests a structural change from a reasonably balanced leagueto a two-tier league which occurred around the early 2000's.
ArXiv;Adaptive Multi-view and Temporal Fusing Transformer for 3D Human Pose  Estimation;Hui Shuai, Lele Wu, Qingshan Liu;2021/10/11;http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05092v2;This paper proposes a unified framework dubbed Multi-view and Temporal FusingTransformer (MTF-Transformer) to adaptively handle varying view numbers andvideo length without camera calibration in 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE). Itconsists of Feature Extractor, Multi-view Fusing Transformer (MFT), andTemporal Fusing Transformer (TFT). Feature Extractor estimates 2D pose fromeach image and fuses the prediction according to the confidence. It providespose-focused feature embedding and makes subsequent modules computationallylightweight. MFT fuses the features of a varying number of views with a novelRelative-Attention block. It adaptively measures the implicit relativerelationship between each pair of views and reconstructs more informativefeatures. TFT aggregates the features of the whole sequence and predicts 3Dpose via a transformer. It adaptively deals with the video of arbitrary lengthand fully unitizes the temporal information. The migration of transformersenables our model to learn spatial geometry better and preserve robustness forvarying application scenarios. We report quantitative and qualitative resultson the Human3.6M, TotalCapture, and KTH Multiview Football II. Compared withstate-of-the-art methods with camera parameters, MTF-Transformer obtainscompetitive results and generalizes well to dynamic capture with an arbitrarynumber of unseen views.
ArXiv;Focus on what matters: Applying Discourse Coherence Theory to Cross  Document Coreference;William Held, Dan Iter, Dan Jurafsky;2021/10/11;http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05362v1;Performing event and entity coreference resolution across documents vastlyincreases the number of candidate mentions, making it intractable to do thefull $n^2$ pairwise comparisons. Existing approaches simplify by consideringcoreference only within document clusters, but this fails to handleinter-cluster coreference, common in many applications. As a resultcross-document coreference algorithms are rarely applied to downstream tasks.We draw on an insight from discourse coherence theory: potential coreferencesare constrained by the reader's discourse focus. We model the entities/eventsin a reader's focus as a neighborhood within a learned latent embedding spacewhich minimizes the distance between mentions and the centroids of their goldcoreference clusters. We then use these neighborhoods to sample only hardnegatives to train a fine-grained classifier on mention pairs and their localdiscourse features. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for bothevents and entities on the ECB+, Gun Violence, Football Coreference, andCross-Domain Cross-Document Coreference corpora. Furthermore, training onmultiple corpora improves average performance across all datasets by 17.2 F1points, leading to a robust coreference resolution model for use in downstreamtasks where link distribution is unknown.

We consider randomvariables that are arbitrarily correlated, and we show that the problem isNP-hard even if the space of feasible solutions is unconstrained. We exploit aclosed-form expression for the objective function from the literature toconstruct a cutting-plane algorithm that can be seen as an extension of theinteger L-shaped method for a highly nonlinear function, which includes theevaluation of the c.d.f and p.d.f of a standard normal random variable withdecision variables as part of the arguments.

The second is a specialcase of makespan minimization for two parallel machines and jobs with uncertainprocessing times; for the special case where the jobs are uncorrelated, weprove the equivalence between its deterministic and stochastic versions andshow that our algorithm can deliver a constant-factor approximation guaranteefor the problem. The results of our computational evaluation involvingsynthetic and real-world data suggest that our discretization and upperbounding techniques lead to significant computational improvements and that theproposed algorithm outperforms sub-optimal solutions approaches."

Here, we report analgorithm -- the Quantum Model Learning Agent (QMLA) -- to reverse engineerHamiltonian descriptions of a target system. We test the performance of QMLA ona number of simulated experiments, demonstrating several mechanisms for thedesign of candidate Hamiltonian models and simultaneously entertaining numeroushypotheses about the nature of the physical interactions governing the systemunder study. QMLA is shown to identify the true model in the majority ofinstances, when provided with limited a priori information, and control of theexperimental setup. Our protocol can explore Ising, Heisenberg and Hubbardfamilies of models in parallel, reliably identifying the family which bestdescribes the system dynamics. We demonstrate QMLA operating on large modelspaces by incorporating a genetic algorithm to formulate new hypotheticalmodels. The selection of models whose features propagate to the next generationis based upon an objective function inspired by the Elo rating scheme,typically used to rate competitors in games such as chess and football. In allinstances, our protocol finds models that exhibit $F_1$-score $\geq 0.88$ whencompared with the true model, and it precisely identifies the true model in 72%of cases, whilst exploring a space of over $250,000$ potential models. Bytesting which interactions actually occur in the target system, QMLA is aviable tool for both the exploration of fundamental physics and thecharacterisation and calibration of quantum devices.

ArXiv;Breaking the Curse of Dimensionality in Multiagent State Space: A  Unified Agent Permutation Framework;Xiaotian Hao, Hangyu Mao, Weixun Wang, Yaodong Yang, Dong Li, Yan Zheng, Zhen Wang, Jianye Hao;2022/03/10;http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05285v2;The state space in Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) growsexponentially with the agent number. Such a curse of dimensionality results inpoor scalability and low sample efficiency, inhibiting MARL for decades. Tobreak this curse, we propose a unified agent permutation framework thatexploits the permutation invariance (PI) and permutation equivariance (PE)inductive biases to reduce the multiagent state space. Our insight is thatpermuting the order of entities in the factored multiagent state space does notchange the information. Specifically, we propose two novel implementations: aDynamic Permutation Network (DPN) and a Hyper Policy Network (HPN). The coreidea is to build separate entity-wise PI input and PE output network modules toconnect the entity-factored state space and action space in an end-to-end way.DPN achieves such connections by two separate module selection networks, whichconsistently assign the same input module to the same input entity (guaranteePI) and assign the same output module to the same entity-related output(guarantee PE). To enhance the representation capability, HPN replaces themodule selection networks of DPN with hypernetworks to directly generate thecorresponding module weights. Extensive experiments in SMAC, Google ResearchFootball and MPE validate that the proposed methods significantly boost theperformance and the learning efficiency of existing MARL algorithms.Remarkably, in SMAC, we achieve 100% win rates in almost all hard andsuper-hard scenarios (never achieved before).

For this paper, we have chosen Football (soccer)as a sport where we would want to create highlights for a given match video,through a computer vision model that aims to identify important events in aSoccer match to create highlights of the match. We built the models based onFaster RCNN and YoloV5 architectures and noticed that for the amount of data weused for training Faster RCNN did better than YoloV5 in detecting the events inthe match though it was much slower. Within Faster RCNN using ResNet50 as abase model gave a better class accuracy of 95.5% as compared to 92% with VGG16as base model completely outperforming YoloV5 for our training dataset. Wetested with an original video of size 23 minutes and our model could reduce itto 4:50 minutes of highlights capturing almost all important events in thematch.
ArXiv;LDSA: Learning Dynamic Subtask Assignment in Cooperative Multi-Agent  Reinforcement Learning;Mingyu Yang, Jian Zhao, Xunhan Hu, Wengang Zhou, Jiangcheng Zhu, Houqiang Li;2022/05/05;http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02561v3;Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made prominentprogress in recent years. For training efficiency and scalability, most of theMARL algorithms make all agents share the same policy or value network.However, in many complex multi-agent tasks, different agents are expected topossess specific abilities to handle different subtasks. In those scenarios,sharing parameters indiscriminately may lead to similar behavior across allagents, which will limit the exploration efficiency and degrade the finalperformance. To balance the training complexity and the diversity of agentbehavior, we propose a novel framework to learn dynamic subtask assignment(LDSA) in cooperative MARL. Specifically, we first introduce a subtask encoderto construct a vector representation for each subtask according to itsidentity. To reasonably assign agents to different subtasks, we propose anability-based subtask selection strategy, which can dynamically group agentswith similar abilities into the same subtask. In this way, agents dealing withthe same subtask share their learning of specific abilities and differentsubtasks correspond to different specific abilities. We further introduce tworegularizers to increase the representation difference between subtasks andstabilize the training by discouraging agents from frequently changingsubtasks, respectively. Empirical results show that LDSA learns reasonable andeffective subtask assignment for better collaboration and significantlyimproves the learning performance on the challenging StarCraft IImicromanagement benchmark and Google Research Football.
ArXiv;Learning Task-Independent Game State Representations from Unlabeled  Images;Chintan Trivedi, Konstantinos Makantasis, Antonios Liapis, Georgios N. Yannakakis;2022/06/13;http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06490v1;Self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques have been widely used to learncompact and informative representations from high-dimensional complex data. Inmany computer vision tasks, such as image classification, such methods achievestate-of-the-art results that surpass supervised learning approaches. In thispaper, we investigate whether SSL methods can be leveraged for the task oflearning accurate state representations of games, and if so, to what extent.For this purpose, we collect game footage frames and corresponding sequences ofgames' internal state from three different 3D games: VizDoom, the CARLA racingsimulator and the Google Research Football Environment. We train an imageencoder with three widely used SSL algorithms using solely the raw frames, andthen attempt to recover the internal state variables from the learnedrepresentations. Our results across all three games showcase significantlyhigher correlation between SSL representations and the game's internal statecompared to pre-trained baseline models such as ImageNet. Such findings suggestthat SSL-based visual encoders can yield general -- not tailored to a specifictask -- yet informative game representations solely from game pixelinformation. Such representations can, in turn, form the basis for boosting theperformance of downstream learning tasks in games, including gameplaying,content generation and player modeling.
ArXiv;Revisiting Some Common Practices in Cooperative Multi-Agent  Reinforcement Learning;Wei Fu, Chao Yu, Zelai Xu, Jiaqi Yang, Yi Wu;2022/06/15;http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07505v2;Many advances in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) arebased on two common design principles: value decomposition and parametersharing. A typical MARL algorithm of this fashion decomposes a centralizedQ-function into local Q-networks with parameters shared across agents. Such analgorithmic paradigm enables centralized training and decentralized execution(CTDE) and leads to efficient learning in practice. Despite all the advantages,we revisit these two principles and show that in certain scenarios, e.g.,environments with a highly multi-modal reward landscape, value decomposition,and parameter sharing can be problematic and lead to undesired outcomes. Incontrast, policy gradient (PG) methods with individual policies provablyconverge to an optimal solution in these cases, which partially supports somerecent empirical observations that PG can be effective in many MARL testbeds.Inspired by our theoretical analysis, we present practical suggestions onimplementing multi-agent PG algorithms for either high rewards or diverseemergent behaviors and empirically validate our findings on a variety ofdomains, ranging from the simplified matrix and grid-world games to complexbenchmarks such as StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge and Google ResearchFootball. We hope our insights could benefit the community towards developingmore general and more powerful MARL algorithms. Check our project website athttps://sites.google.com/view/revisiting-marl.

Given the growing amount of player tracking data, sportsanalytics models are increasingly utilizing spatially-derived features builtupon player tracking data. However, player-specific information, such aslocation, cannot readily be included as features themselves, since commonmodeling techniques rely on vector input. Accordingly, spatially-derivedfeatures are commonly constructed in relation to anchor objects, such as thedistance to a ball or goal, through global feature aggregations, or viarole-assignment schemes, where players are designated a distinct role in thegame. In doing so, we sacrifice inter-player and local relationships in favorof global ones. To address this issue, we introduce a sport-agnosticgraph-based representation of game states. We then use our proposed graphrepresentation as input to graph neural networks to predict sports outcomes.Our approach preserves permutation invariance and allows for flexible playerinteraction weights. We demonstrate how our method provides statisticallysignificant improvements over the state of the art for prediction tasks in bothAmerican football and esports, reducing test set loss by 9% and 20%,respectively. Additionally, we show how our model can be used to answer ""whatif"" questions in sports and to visualize relationships between players."

Its automaticunderstanding can facilitate a more naturalistic human-device interaction andthe humanisation of artificial intelligence. Current methods of humourdetection are solely based on staged data making them inadequate for'real-world' applications. We address this deficiency by introducing the novelPassau-Spontaneous Football Coach Humour (Passau-SFCH) dataset, comprising ofabout 11 hours of recordings. The Passau-SFCH dataset is annotated for thepresence of humour and its dimensions (sentiment and direction) as proposed inMartin's Humor Style Questionnaire. We conduct a series of experiments,employing pretrained Transformers, convolutional neural networks, andexpert-designed features. The performance of each modality (text, audio, video)for spontaneous humour recognition is analysed and their complementarity isinvestigated. Our findings suggest that for the automatic analysis of humourand its sentiment, facial expressions are most promising, while humourdirection can be best modelled via text-based features. The results revealconsiderable differences among various subjects, highlighting the individualityof humour usage and style. Further, we observe that a decision-level fusionyields the best recognition result. Finally, we make our code publiclyavailable at https://www.github.com/EIHW/passau-sfch.

However, no studies habe integrated HAE, motor-control behavior,sMRI and fMRI measures. Here, brain networks important for motor-control werehypothesized to show changes in tractography-based diffusion weighted imaging[difference in fractional anisotropy (dFA)] and resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI)measures in collegiate American football players across the season, and thatthese measures would relate to VR-based motor-control. We firther tested ifnine inflammation-related miRNAs were associated withbehavior-structure-function variables. Using permutation-based mediation andmoderation methods, we found that across-season dFA from the SM structuralconnectome (SM-dFA) mediated the relationship between across-season VR-basedSensory-motor Reactivity (dSR) and rs-fMRI SM fingerprint similarity (p = 0.007and Teff = 47%). The interaction between dSR and SM-dFA also predicted (pF =0.036, pbeta3 = 0.058) across-season levels of dmiRNA-30d throughpermutation-based moderation analysis.

ArXiv;ELIGN: Expectation Alignment as a Multi-Agent Intrinsic Reward;Zixian Ma, Rose Wang, Li Fei-Fei, Michael Bernstein, Ranjay Krishna;2022/10/09;http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04365v2;Modern multi-agent reinforcement learning frameworks rely on centralizedtraining and reward shaping to perform well. However, centralized training anddense rewards are not readily available in the real world. Current multi-agentalgorithms struggle to learn in the alternative setup of decentralized trainingor sparse rewards. To address these issues, we propose a self-supervisedintrinsic reward ELIGN - expectation alignment - inspired by theself-organization principle in Zoology. Similar to how animals collaborate in adecentralized manner with those in their vicinity, agents trained withexpectation alignment learn behaviors that match their neighbors' expectations.This allows the agents to learn collaborative behaviors without any externalreward or centralized training. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approachacross 6 tasks in the multi-agent particle and the complex Google Researchfootball environments, comparing ELIGN to sparse and curiosity-based intrinsicrewards. When the number of agents increases, ELIGN scales well in allmulti-agent tasks except for one where agents have different capabilities. Weshow that agent coordination improves through expectation alignment becauseagents learn to divide tasks amongst themselves, break coordination symmetries,and confuse adversaries. These results identify tasks where expectationalignment is a more useful strategy than curiosity-driven exploration formulti-agent coordination, enabling agents to do zero-shot coordination.

We focus on two primary outcomes measured at ages 23--28 --self-rated health and total score on the PHQ9 Patient Depression Questionnaire-- and control for several potential confounders related to demographics andfamily socioeconomic status. Comparing outcomes between sports participants andmatched non-sports participants with similar confounders is straightforward.Unfortunately, an analysis based on such a broad exposure cannot probe thepossibility that participation in certain types of sports (e.g. collisionsports like football or soccer) may have larger effects on health than others.  In this study, we introduce a hierarchy of exposure definitions, ranging frombroad (participation in any after-school organized activity) to narrow (e.g.participation in limited-contact sports). We will perform separate matchedobservational studies, one for each definition, to estimate the health effectsof several levels of sports participation. In order to conduct these studieswhile maintaining a fixed family-wise error rate, we developed an orderedtesting approach that exploits the logical relationships between exposuredefinitions. Our study will also consider several secondary outcomes includingbody mass index, life satisfaction, and problematic drinking behavior.
ArXiv;ACE: Cooperative Multi-agent Q-learning with Bidirectional  Action-Dependency;Chuming Li, Jie Liu, Yinmin Zhang, Yuhong Wei, Yazhe Niu, Yaodong Yang, Yu Liu, Wanli Ouyang;2022/11/29;http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16068v2;Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) suffers from the non-stationarityproblem, which is the ever-changing targets at every iteration when multipleagents update their policies at the same time. Starting from first principle,in this paper, we manage to solve the non-stationarity problem by proposingbidirectional action-dependent Q-learning (ACE). Central to the development ofACE is the sequential decision-making process wherein only one agent is allowedto take action at one time. Within this process, each agent maximizes its valuefunction given the actions taken by the preceding agents at the inferencestage. In the learning phase, each agent minimizes the TD error that isdependent on how the subsequent agents have reacted to their chosen action.Given the design of bidirectional dependency, ACE effectively turns amultiagent MDP into a single-agent MDP. We implement the ACE framework byidentifying the proper network representation to formulate the actiondependency, so that the sequential decision process is computed implicitly inone forward pass. To validate ACE, we compare it with strong baselines on twoMARL benchmarks. Empirical experiments demonstrate that ACE outperforms thestate-of-the-art algorithms on Google Research Football and StarCraftMulti-Agent Challenge by a large margin. In particular, on SMAC tasks, ACEachieves 100% success rate on almost all the hard and super-hard maps. Wefurther study extensive research problems regarding ACE, including extension,generalization, and practicability. Code is made available to facilitatefurther research.

Mouthguards are used to measure head kinematicsduring impacts in traumatic brain injury (TBI) studies, but deviations fromreference kinematics can still occur due to potential looseness. In this study,deep learning is used to compensate for the imperfect interface and improvemeasurement accuracy. A set of one-dimensional convolutional neural network(1D-CNN) models was developed to denoise mouthguard kinematics measurementsalong three spatial axes of linear acceleration and angular velocity. Thedenoised kinematics had significantly reduced errors compared to referencekinematics, and reduced errors in brain injury criteria and tissue strain andstrain rate calculated via finite element modeling. The 1D-CNN models were alsotested on an on-field dataset of college football impacts and a post-mortemhuman subject dataset, with similar denoising effects observed. The models canbe used to improve detection of head impacts and TBI risk evaluation, andpotentially extended to other sensors measuring kinematics.

Lampoltshammer, Nike Pulda, Ursula Rosenbichler, Stefan Thurner, Peter Klimek;2022/12/21;http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11018v1;Many European countries face rising obesity rates among children, compoundedby decreased opportunities for sports activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.Access to sports facilities depends on multiple factors, such as geographiclocation, proximity to population centers, budgetary constraints, and othersocio-economic covariates. Here we show how an optimal allocation of governmentfunds towards sports facilitators (e.g. sports clubs) can be achieved in adata-driven simulation model that maximizes children's access to sportsfacilities. We compile a dataset for all 1,854 football clubs in Austria,including estimates for their budget, geolocation, tally, and the age profileof their members. We find a characteristic sub-linear relationship between thenumber of active club members and the budget, which depends on thesocio-economic conditions of the clubs' municipality. In the model, where weassume this relationship to be causal, we evaluate different fundingstrategies. We show that an optimization strategy where funds are distributedbased on regional socio-economic characteristics and club budgets outperforms anaive approach by up to 117\% in attracting children to sports clubs for 5million Euros of additional funding. Our results suggest that the impact ofpublic funding strategies can be substantially increased by tailoring them toregional socio-economic characteristics in an evidence-based and individualizedway.
ArXiv;A Networks and Machine Learning Approach to Determine the Best College  Coaches of the 20th-21st Centuries;Tian-Shun Jiang, Zachary Polizzi, Christopher Yuan;2014/04/08;http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2885v1;Our objective is to find the five best college sports coaches of past centuryfor three different sports. We decided to look at men's basketball, football,and baseball. We wanted to use an approach that could definitively determineteam skill from the games played, and then use a machine-learning algorithm tocalculate the correct coach skills for each team in a given year. We created anetworks-based model to calculate team skill from historical game data. Adigraph was created for each year in each sport. Nodes represented teams, andedges represented a game played between two teams. The arrowhead pointedtowards the losing team. We calculated the team skill of each graph using aright-hand eigenvector centrality measure. This way, teams that beat good teamswill be ranked higher than teams that beat mediocre teams. The eigenvectorcentrality rankings for most years were well correlated with tournamentperformance and poll-based rankings. We assumed that the relationship betweencoach skill $C_s$, player skill $P_s$, and team skill $T_s$ was $C_s \cdot P_s= T_s$. We then created a function to describe the probability that a givenscore difference would occur based on player skill and coach skill. Wemultiplied the probabilities of all edges in the network together to find theprobability that the correct network would occur with any given player skilland coach skill matrix. We was able to determine player skill as a function ofteam skill and coach skill, eliminating the need to optimize two unknownmatrices. The top five coaches in each year were noted, and the top coach ofall time was calculated by dividing the number of times that coach ranked inthe yearly top five by the years said coach had been active.
ArXiv;Accurate and Efficient Profile Matching in Knowledge Bases;Jorge Martinez-Gil, Alejandra Lorena Paoletti, Gábor Rácz, Attila Sali, Klaus-Dieter Schewe;2017/06/21;http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06944v3;A profile describes a set of properties, e.g. a set of skills a person mayhave, a set of skills required for a particular job, or a set of abilities afootball player may have with respect to a particular team strategy. Profilematching aims to determine how well a given profile fits to a requestedprofile. The approach taken in this article is grounded in a matching theorythat uses filters in lattices to represent profiles, and matching values in theinterval [0,1]: the higher the matching value the better is the fit. Suchlattices can be derived from knowledge bases exploiting description logics torepresent the knowledge about profiles. An interesting first question is, howhuman expertise concerning the matching can be exploited to obtain mostaccurate matchings. It will be shown that if a set of filters together withmatching values by some human expert is given, then under some mildplausibility assumptions a matching measure can be determined such that thecomputed matching values preserve the rankings given by the expert. A secondquestion concerns the efficient querying of databases of profile instances. Formatching queries that result in a ranked list of profile instances matching agiven one it will be shown how corresponding top-k queries can be evaluated ongrounds of pre-computed matching values, which in turn allows the maintenanceof the knowledge base to be decoupled from the maintenance of profileinstances. In addition, it will be shown how the matching queries can beexploited for gap queries that determine how profile instances need to beextended in order to improve in the rankings. Finally, the theory of matchingwill be extended beyond the filters, which lead to a matching theory thatexploits fuzzy sets or probabilistic logic with maximum entropy semantics. Itwill be shown that added fuzzy links can be captured by extending theunderlying lattice.
ArXiv;Optimized Deployment of Millimeter Wave Networks for In-venue Regions  with Stochastic Users' Orientation;Mehdi Naderi Soorki, Walid Saad, Mehdi Bennis;2019/06/06;http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02491v1;Millimeter wave (mmW) communication is a promising solution for providinghigh-capacity wireless network access. However, the benefits of mmW are limitedby the fact that the channel between a mmW access point and the user equipmentcan stochastically change due to severe blockage of mmW links by obstacles suchas the human body. Thus, one main challenge of mmW network coverage is toenable directional line-of-sight links between access points and mobiledevices. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed for optimizing mmWnetwork coverage within hotspots and in-venue regions, while being cognizant ofthe body blockage of the network's users. In the studied model, the locationsof potential access points and users are assumed as predefined parameters whilethe orientation of the users is assumed to be stochastic. Hence, a jointstochastic access point placement and beam steering problem subjected tostochastic users' body blockage is formulated, under desired network coverageconstraints. Then, a greedy algorithm is introduced to find an approximationsolution for the joint deployment and assignment problem using a new `sizeconstrained weighted set cover' approach. A closed-form expression for theratio between the optimal solution and approximate one (resulting from thegreedy algorithm) is analytically derived. The proposed algorithm is simulatedfor three in-venue regions: the meeting room in the Alumni Assembly Hall ofVirginia Tech, an airport gate, and one side of a stadium football. Simulationresults show that, in order to guarantee network coverage for differentin-venue regions, the greedy algorithm uses at most three more access points(APs) compared to the optimal solution. The results also show that, due to theuse of the additional APs, the greedy algorithm will yield a network coverageup to 11.7 % better than the optimal, AP-minimizing solution.
ArXiv;"Footballonomics: The Anatomy of American Football; Evidence from 7 years  of NFL game data";Konstantinos Pelechrinis, Evangelos Papalexakis;2016/01/17;http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04302v6;"Do NFL teams make rational decisions? What factors potentially affect theprobability of wining a game in NFL? How can a team come back from ademoralizing interception? In this study we begin by examining the hypothesisof rational coaching, that is, coaching decisions are always rational withrespect to the maximization of the expected points scored. We reject thishypothesis by analyzing the decisions made in the past 7 NFL seasons for twoparticular plays; (i) the Point(s) After Touchdown (PAT) and (ii) the fourthdown decisions. Having rejected the rational coaching hypothesis we move on toexamine how the detailed game data collected can potentially inform game-daydecisions. While NFL teams personnel definitely have an intuition on whichfactors are crucial for winning a game, in this work we take a data-drivenapproach and provide quantifiable evidence using a large dataset of NFL gamesfor the 7-year period between 2009 and 2015. In particular, we use a logisticregression model to identify the impact and the corresponding statisticalsignificance of factors such as possession time, number of penalty yards,balance between passing and rushing offense etc. Our results clearly imply thatavoiding turnovers is the best strategy for winning a game but turnovers can beovercome with letting the offense on the field for more time. Finally wecombine our descriptive model with statistical bootstrap in order to provide aprediction engine for upcoming NFL games. Our evaluations indicate that even byonly considering a small number of (straightforward) factors, we can achieve avery good prediction accuracy. In particular, the average accuracy duringseasons 2014 and 2015 is approximately 63%. This performance is comparable tothe more complicated state-of-the-art prediction systems, while it outperformsexpert analysts 60% of the time."
ArXiv;Two-Sample Testing on Ranked Preference Data and the Role of Modeling  Assumptions;Charvi Rastogi, Sivaraman Balakrishnan, Nihar B. Shah, Aarti Singh;2020/06/21;http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11909v2;A number of applications require two-sample testing on ranked preferencedata. For instance, in crowdsourcing, there is a long-standing question ofwhether pairwise comparison data provided by people is distributed similar toratings-converted-to-comparisons. Other examples include sports data analysisand peer grading. In this paper, we design two-sample tests for pairwisecomparison data and ranking data. For our two-sample test for pairwisecomparison data, we establish an upper bound on the sample complexity requiredto correctly distinguish between the distributions of the two sets of samples.Our test requires essentially no assumptions on the distributions. We thenprove complementary lower bounds showing that our results are tight (in theminimax sense) up to constant factors. We investigate the role of modelingassumptions by proving lower bounds for a range of pairwise comparison models(WST, MST,SST, parameter-based such as BTL and Thurstone). We also providetesting algorithms and associated sample complexity bounds for the problem oftwo-sample testing with partial (or total) ranking data.Furthermore, weempirically evaluate our results via extensive simulations as well as tworeal-world datasets consisting of pairwise comparisons. By applying ourtwo-sample test on real-world pairwise comparison data, we conclude thatratings and rankings provided by people are indeed distributed differently. Onthe other hand, our test recognizes no significant difference in the relativeperformance of European football teams across two seasons. Finally, we applyour two-sample test on a real-world partial and total ranking dataset and finda statistically significant difference in Sushi preferences across demographicdivisions based on gender, age and region of residence.
ArXiv;Enhancing Unsupervised Video Representation Learning by Decoupling the  Scene and the Motion;Jinpeng Wang, Yuting Gao, Ke Li, Jianguo Hu, Xinyang Jiang, Xiaowei Guo, Rongrong Ji, Xing Sun;2020/09/12;http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05757v3;One significant factor we expect the video representation learning tocapture, especially in contrast with the image representation learning, is theobject motion. However, we found that in the current mainstream video datasets,some action categories are highly related with the scene where the actionhappens, making the model tend to degrade to a solution where only the sceneinformation is encoded. For example, a trained model may predict a video asplaying football simply because it sees the field, neglecting that the subjectis dancing as a cheerleader on the field. This is against our originalintention towards the video representation learning and may bring scene bias ondifferent dataset that can not be ignored. In order to tackle this problem, wepropose to decouple the scene and the motion (DSM) with two simple operations,so that the model attention towards the motion information is better paid.Specifically, we construct a positive clip and a negative clip for each video.Compared to the original video, the positive/negative ismotion-untouched/broken but scene-broken/untouched by Spatial Local Disturbanceand Temporal Local Disturbance. Our objective is to pull the positive closerwhile pushing the negative farther to the original clip in the latent space. Inthis way, the impact of the scene is weakened while the temporal sensitivity ofthe network is further enhanced. We conduct experiments on two tasks withvarious backbones and different pre-training datasets, and find that our methodsurpass the SOTA methods with a remarkable 8.1% and 8.8% improvement towardsaction recognition task on the UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets respectively usingthe same backbone.

Camarillo;2020/10/16;http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08485v1;Despite numerous research efforts, the precise mechanisms of concussion haveyet to be fully uncovered. Clinical studies on high-risk populations, such ascontact sports athletes, have become more common and give insight on the linkbetween impact severity and brain injury risk through the use of wearablesensors and neurological testing. However, as the number of institutionsoperating these studies grows, there is a growing need for a platform to sharethese data to facilitate our understanding of concussion mechanisms and aid inthe development of suitable diagnostic tools. To that end, this paper putsforth two contributions: 1) a centralized, open-source platform for storing andsharing head impact data, in collaboration with the Federal InteragencyTraumatic Brain Injury Research informatics system (FITBIR), and 2) a deeplearning impact detection algorithm (MiGNet) to differentiate between true headimpacts and false positives for the previously biomechanically validatedinstrumented mouthguard sensor (MiG2.0), all of which easily interfaces withFITBIR. We report 96% accuracy using MiGNet, based on a neural network model,improving on previous work based on Support Vector Machines achieving 91%accuracy, on an out of sample dataset of high school and collegiate footballhead impacts. The integrated MiG2.0 and FITBIR system serve as a collaborativeresearch tool to be disseminated across multiple institutions towards creatinga standardized dataset for furthering the knowledge of concussion biomechanics.
ArXiv;Deep Learning Head Model for Real-time Estimation of Entire Brain  Deformation in Concussion;Xianghao Zhan, Yuzhe Liu, Samuel J. Raymond, Hossein Vahid Alizadeh, August G. Domel, Olivier Gevaert, Michael Zeineh, Gerald Grant, David B. Camarillo;2020/10/16;http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08527v2;Objective: Many recent studies have suggested that brain deformationresulting from a head impact is linked to the corresponding clinical outcome,such as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Even though several finite element(FE) head models have been developed and validated to calculate braindeformation based on impact kinematics, the clinical application of these FEhead models is limited due to the time-consuming nature of FE simulations. Thiswork aims to accelerate the process of brain deformation calculation and thusimprove the potential for clinical applications. Methods: We propose a deeplearning head model with a five-layer deep neural network and featureengineering, and trained and tested the model on 1803 total head impacts from acombination of head model simulations and on-field college football and mixedmartial arts impacts. Results: The proposed deep learning head model cancalculate the maximum principal strain for every element in the entire brain inless than 0.001s (with an average root mean squared error of 0.025, and with astandard deviation of 0.002 over twenty repeats with random data partition andmodel initialization). The contributions of various features to the predictivepower of the model were investigated, and it was noted that the features basedon angular acceleration were found to be more predictive than the featuresbased on angular velocity. Conclusion: Trained using the dataset of 1803 headimpacts, this model can be applied to various sports in the calculation ofbrain strain with accuracy, and its applicability can even further be extendedby incorporating data from other types of head impacts. Significance: Inaddition to the potential clinical application in real-time brain deformationmonitoring, this model will help researchers estimate the brain strain from alarge number of head impacts more efficiently than using FE models.
ArXiv;A Distributed Algorithm for Overlapped Community Detection in  Large-Scale Networks;Dibakar Saha, Partha Sarathi Mandal;2020/11/11;http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05954v1;Overlapped community detection in social networks has become an importantresearch area with the increasing popularity and complexity of the networks.Most of the existing solutions are either centralized or parallel algorithms,which are computationally intensive - require complete knowledge of the entirenetworks. But it isn't easy to collect entire network data because the size ofthe actual networks may be prohibitively large. This may be a result of eitherprivacy concerns or technological impediments. Performing in-networkcomputation solves both problems utilizing the computational capability of theindividual nodes of the network. Simultaneously, nodes communicate and sharedata with their neighbors via message passing, which may go a long way towardmitigating individual nodes' privacy concerns in the network. All theaforementioned concerns motivated us to design a decentralized or distributedtechnique to detect overlapped communities in a large-scale network. It isdesirable because this technique does not offer a single point of failure, andthe system as a whole can continue to function even when many of the nodesfail. In this paper, we address the overlapped community detection problem forlarge-scale networks. We present an efficient distributed algorithm, namedDOCD, to identify the overlapped communities in the network. The DOCDalgorithm's efficiency is verified with extensive simulation study on realnetwork data such as Dolphin, Zachary karate club, Football club, and Facebookego networks. We show that DOCD algorithm is capable of keeping theasymptotically same results with the existing classical centralized algorithmsin terms of community modularity and the number of identified communities. TheDOCD algorithm can also efficiently identify the overlapped nodes andoverlapped communities with a small number of rounds of communication andcomputation.
ArXiv;A comparison of sports-related head accelerations with and without  direct head impacts;Samuel J. Raymond, Yuzhe Liu, Nicholas J. Cecchi, Eli Rice, Ashlyn A. Callan, Landon P. Watson, Sohrab Sami, Zhou Zhou, Xiaogai Li, Svein Kleiven, Michael Zeineh, David B. Camarillo;2021/08/19;http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08763v2;Concussion and repeated exposure to mild traumatic brain injury are risks forathletes in many sports. While direct head impacts are analyzed to improve thedetection and awareness of head acceleration events so that an athlete's brainhealth can be appropriately monitored and treated. However, head accelerationscan also be induced by impacts with little or no head involvement. In this workwe evaluated if impacts that do not involve direct head contact, such as beingpushed in the torso, can be sufficient in collegiate American football toinduce head accelerations comparable to direct head impacts. Datasets ofimpacts with and without direct head contact were collected and compared. Thesedatasets were gathered using a state-of-the-art impact detection algorithmembedded in an instrumented mouthguard to record head kinematics. Videoanalysis was used to differentiate between impact types. In total, 15 impactsof each type were used in comparison, with clear video screenshots available todistinguish each impact type. Analysis of the kinematics showed that theimpacts without direct head contact achieved similar levels of linear andangular accelerations during impact compared to those from direct head impacts.Finite element analyses using the median and peak kinematic signals were usedto calculate maximum principal strain of the brain. Statistical analysisrevealed that no significant difference was found between the two datasetsbased on a Bonferroni-adjusted p-value threshold of 0.017 , with the exceptionof peak linear acceleration. Impacts without direct head contact showed highermean values of peak linear acceleration values of 17.6 g compared to thedirect-head impact mean value of 6.1g. These results indicated that impactsother than direct head impacts could still produce meaningful kinematic loadsin the head and as such should be included in athlete health monitoring.
ArXiv;Rapidly and accurately estimating brain strain and strain rate across  head impact types with transfer learning and data fusion;Xianghao Zhan, Yuzhe Liu, Nicholas J. Cecchi, Olivier Gevaert, Michael M. Zeineh, Gerald A. Grant, David B. Camarillo;2021/08/31;http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13577v1;Brain strain and strain rate are effective in predicting traumatic braininjury (TBI) caused by head impacts. However, state-of-the-art finite elementmodeling (FEM) demands considerable computational time in the computation,limiting its application in real-time TBI risk monitoring. To accelerate,machine learning head models (MLHMs) were developed, and the model accuracy wasfound to decrease when the training/test datasets were from different headimpacts types. However, the size of dataset for specific impact types may notbe enough for model training. To address the computational cost of FEM, thelimited strain rate prediction, and the generalizability of MLHMs to on-fielddatasets, we propose data fusion and transfer learning to develop a series ofMLHMs to predict the maximum principal strain (MPS) and maximum principalstrain rate (MPSR). We trained and tested the MLHMs on 13,623 head impacts fromsimulations, American football, mixed martial arts, car crash, and comparedagainst the models trained on only simulations or only on-field impacts. TheMLHMs developed with transfer learning are significantly more accurate inestimating MPS and MPSR than other models, with a mean absolute error (MAE)smaller than 0.03 in predicting MPS and smaller than 7 (1/s) in predicting MPSRon all impact datasets. The MLHMs can be applied to various head impact typesfor rapidly and accurately calculating brain strain and strain rate. Besidesthe clinical applications in real-time brain strain and strain rate monitoring,this model helps researchers estimate the brain strain and strain rate causedby head impacts more efficiently than FEM.
