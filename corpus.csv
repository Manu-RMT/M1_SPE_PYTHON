And you decide to leave all that for.... Juventus? A club with much weaker squad, that plays in much less competitive league, and hasn't won the CL for 20 years? Why? Why would you do that?
Reddit;Does Mbappe already have the accolades to go down as an all time great?;soccerboy1356;2023/01/03;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/101sn48/does_mbappe_already_have_the_accolades_to_go_down/;"I had someone tell me that Mbappe is already an all time great and I'm not sure how to feel about it at this current point, so I figured I'd go to reddit. He has currently played - as per Transfermarkt - 304 appearances equating to 22,756 minutes and only 299 games discounting youth games. He has 218 goals and 108 assists, meaning he has 326 G+A in 299 games. This means he contributes either a goal or assist every 69 minutes (if you round up from 69.69). He has a world cup to his name and has 5 league trophies and 8 domestic cups to his name. He passes the eye test for most people as well, but this is subjective. &#x200B;I don't think he falls into that extremely high echelon of players such as your Gerd Muller, Eusebio, Puskas, Van Basten, etc. but I think you could make an argument for him being in that tier of Eto'o, Raul, Shevchenko, etc. already at this point."

Reddit;My thoughts on Liverpools attack this season;itisme1256;2023/01/03;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/101rx2h/my_thoughts_on_liverpools_attack_this_season/; As we all know far too well, it hasn't been the greatest season for us so far. But even more worryingly, it doesn't seem like this team has the key elements needed to re-start our season and drive us into top 4 contention. Throughout the season all 3 key aspects of attack, midfield and defence have been at best inconsistent and at worst woeful. A lot has been said about our need for new signings and I fully agree that at least 2 new midfielders are needed in the next couple of transfer windows, however for now (as it doesn't look likely that there will be a new signing this January) we need to work with what we have.Attack: A lot has been said about our lack of potency this season, and particularly about Nunez and his inconsistent finishing. But for me more worrying is the lack of cohesion that can be seen in our front 3. One of the greatest things about Firmino, Salah and Mane (plus Jota and Diaz later on) was their suitability to any attacking role - Mane being a great example who often transitioned between all three positions within a game. And I just don't see that with this current attack. Salah has been relegated to a much wider, conventional winger role (although when he has got through the middle he has been devastating, such as against Rangers), Firmino isn't the player he used to be and Nunez lacks the basic technical ability to be a true successor to Mane - and this use of him as a focal point means that the role of Salah, Diaz and Firmino is massively diminished. Although the signing of Gakpo is a step in the right direction, and Klopp looks to be building a fantastic, young and talented attack for the future, right now there isn't the threat there has been over the past 5 years - we simply don't look like scoring 2 or even 3 times a game without mistakes from the opposing team (or in the case of Leicester, 2 own goals).

Or even some basic things: the amount of images and videos we have to watch the older players is quite few compared to that of nowadays. Even old people might do not have that clear images in their mind from those years.It's like asking 'was Hippocrates a better doctor than René Favaloro?' The change medicine had undergone is brutal for that question to be resolved and though of course the change in football isn't that big, it has to be taken into account.

To the point where I'd confidently say a player like prime Pele would genuinely be a Championship or League 1 player. I don't think he'd be anywhere near the highest level.Today's  professionals are faster, stronger, more dynamic, more explosive, neater, more clinical, have better tactical vision, are more professional, more disciplined and are legitimately superior than players of the past.I think players born during the 70's (Zidane era) are the generation with whom we can directly compare side-by-side with modern players.I'd love someone to change my mind. I just think those old legends were relatively  wonderful, but fundamentally average.

Reddit;Mbappé sayings about South American football being underdeveloped compared with the European football triggered several people... but is it true?;idontdomath8;2022/12/31;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zzmdvb/mbappé_sayings_about_south_american_football/;"The date was May 25th 2022. Mbappé was giving [an interview to TNT Sports Brazil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NCCrRMca_0) and he said a phrase that touched many, **many** people in South America:**Original (in French):**>""L'avantage qu'on a nous les Européens, c'est qu’on joue toujours entre nous, et on a des matchs de haut niveau, comme par exemple la Ligue des Nations. Quand on arrive à la Coupe du Monde, on est prêts. Là où le Brésil et l'Argentine n'ont pas ce niveau-là en Amérique du Sud. Le football n'est pas aussi avancé qu'en Europe. C'est pour ça que lors des dernières Coupes du monde, ce sont toujours les Européens qui ont gagné.""**Translation (in English):**>""The advantage we Europeans have is that we always play between us, in high level matches like the Nations League. When we arrive to the World Cup, we are ready. Brazil and Argentina don't have that level in South America. The football is not as advanced as here in Europe. That's why the last World Champions are always Europeans.""Lautaro Martínez, Richarlison, Fabinho and multiple other South American players replied to his sayings by pointing that the football level in the Conmebol is pretty high and the extra difficulties (like weather, altitude) made the matches pretty intense. But if we check the facts... **is it true what Mbappé said?**I'll do my best to don't be biased in this analysis (since I'm Argentinian) so I'll focus purely in results and stats, what aren't subjectives at all. I'll check four different but related topics, the **WC best performances**, **WC worst performances, WC mean performances** and **head to head results**, for the last 4 World Cups (I think there's no point to check results for +15 years ago if the debate is about nowadays performance).# World Cup best performances:The first point to check is the best teams of every one of these 4 World Cups, so we'll take a look to the teams that completed the 7 games in each tournament, the semi-finalists.* South Africa 2010: Uruguay, Netherlands, Germany, Spain* Brazil 2014: Brazil, Germany, Argentina, Netherlands* Russia 2018: France, Belgium, Croatia, England* Qatar 2022: Argentina, Croatia, France, Morocco.If we sum up the results for each confederation, we have 11 UEFA teams, 4 Conmebol teams and 1 CAF team, clear advantage for Europe. But we must take into account how many slots each confederation has, because there are different amounts of qualified teams from each continent. For the last 4 World Cups, the slots assigned were the same in each tournament:* AFC: 4.5 teams (\~14% out of 32).* CAF: 5 teams (\~16% out of 32).* Concacaf: 3.5 teams (\~11% out of 32).* Conmebol: 4.5 teams (\~14% out of 32).* OFC: 0.5 teams (\~2% out of 32).* UEFA: 13 teams (\~41% out of 32).So, considering the percentage of participants from each confederation, in 4 World Cups would be expected to have 6.5 semi-finalists from UEFA and 2.2 semi-finalists from Conmebol. Clearly, because of the low level from CAF, AFC, Concacaf and OFC, both UEFA and Conmebol are overperforming, almost by doubling the expected semi-finalists in 4 tournaments.# World Cup worst performances:The only way to see the worst performances in the tournaments is using the **final standings table** (although I'm not a big fan of it, I believe that it doesn't really represent the performances of the teams). Because of having much more teams qualified, it's expected that there will be UEFA teams in lower positions compared to Conmebol teams, but how many European teams were *worst* than the worst South American team in every World Cup?**South Africa 2010:*** Worst team from Conmebol: Chile (10th)* UEFA teams lower than 10th: 10 teams (77%) - Portugal (11th), England (13th), Slovakia (16th), Slovenia (18th), Switzerland (19th), Serbia (23rd), Denmark (24th), Greece (25th), Italy (26th), France (29th).**Brazil 2014:*** Worst team from Conmebol: Ecuador (17th)* UEFA teams lower than 17th: 7 teams (54%) - Portugal (18th), Croatia (19th), Bosnia (20th), Italy (22nd), Spain (23rd), Russia (24th), England (26th).**Russia 2018:*** Worst team from Conmebol: Peru (20th)* UEFA teams lower than 20th: 4 teams (31%) - Germany (22nd), Serbia (23rd), Poland (25th), Iceland (28th).**Qatar 2022:*** Worst team from Conmebol: Uruguay (20th)* UEFA teams lower than 20th: 4 teams (31%) - Belgium (23rd), Denmark (28th), Serbia (29th), Wales (30th).We can get from this information that there are always several European teams in the bottom of the final standings, and even the worst South American teams tend to be at least at mid of the table.# World Cup mean performances:Again, using the same **final standings table**, we can check easily which is the mean position for every confederation in every World Cup, just by grabbing every team for each continent together and then getting the mean position. The results are the following:**South Africa 2010:*** AFC: 4 teams, average position: 20th.* CAF: 5 teams, average position: 22nd.* Concacaf: 3 teams, average position: 19th.* Conmebol: 5 teams, average position: 7th.* OFC: 1 team, average position: 22nd.* UEFA: 13 teams, average position: 16th.**Brazil 2014:*** AFC: 4 teams, average position: 29th.* CAF: 5 teams, average position: 22nd.* Concacaf: 3 teams, average position: 16th.* Conmebol: 5 teams, average position: 8th.* OFC: no teams.* UEFA: 13 teams, average position: 15th.**Russia 2018:*** AFC: 4 teams, average position: 21st.* CAF: 5 teams, average position: 24nd.* Concacaf: 3 teams, average position: 24th.* Conmebol: 5 teams, average position: 11th.* OFC: no teams.* UEFA: 13 teams, average position: 12th.**Qatar 2022:*** AFC: 4 teams, average position: 20th.* CAF: 5 teams, average position: 16nd.* Concacaf: 3 teams, average position: 24th.* Conmebol: 4 teams, average position: 12th.* OFC: no teams.* UEFA: 13 teams, average position: 15th.The average position of every confederation help us see how good they perform in every World Cup in general, where we can see that despite the fact that 3 out of the last 4 champions are European, there are several teams with a level so low that makes the mean UEFA position be lower than the mean Conmebol position in every World Cup (even in Russia where the 4 semi-finalists where European).# Head to headsLast but not least (indeed, I think this is the most important topic) we should see every match where a South American team faced an European one. If we check the records for each of the last 4 World Cups, we could see the following results:* South Africa 2010: 3-3-6* Brazil 2014: 8-2-5* Russia 2018: 4-4-5* Qatar 2022: 4-4-1* **Total: 19-13-17**So we can see that in general the Conmebol teams perform slightly better against UEFA teams. Many people tend to say that Argentina and Brazil carry the full confederation, so let's remove both from this head-to-heads and check again the records. We end up with:* South Africa 2010: 2-2-4* Brazil 2014: 4-1-2* Russia 2018: 3-1-3* Qatar 2022: 0-1-1* **Total: 9-5-10**The result is that the record is practically even again, in this scenario with the Europeans ahead just by one match. But doing this last research makes me think that it's unfair removing the best performing teams from South America but considering every team from Europe. We could also say that the big UEFA teams from the last 4 World Cups carried the whole confederation, like Germany, France and the Netherlands. So if we remove those 3 teams too we get these final record:* South Africa 2010: 2-1-2* Brazil 2014: 4-0-1* Russia 2018: 3-1-1* Qatar 2022: 0-0-1* **Total: 9-2-5**In this scenario we can see a more clear difference in favor of South American teams, who have won almost twice as the European teams. So we can conclude that the mid-level teams in Conmebol have an advantage over the mid-level teams in UEFA.# Final thoughtsAfter doing all this research my personal conclusion is that Mbappé sayings weren't just out of the line, but they were also incorrect. It is true that 4 out of the last 5 World Cup champions were European, but it's also true that UEFA has almost 3 times the slots that Conmebol has, and when they face each other there is almost no difference (I could even say that the South American teams perform better). It is also true that there were fantastic European teams in the last World Cups, and maybe the reason why most of the champions came from UEFA was because the big Conmebol teams (Argentina and Brazil) couldn't get solid teams in the last tournaments, and since there are much less South American teams, most of the continent hopes resides in just a pair of teams (despite the fact that teams like Uruguay, Paraguay and Colombia made great appearances). And finally, there are many, **many** European teams that have a pretty lame level, who usually finish in the last standings of each World Cup, and they are also part of Europe, and when talking about UEFA we must also consider them, not just the big teams that we all know about.What are your opinions on this subject? I'll also try to post this in r/soccer and r/worldcup, just in case that it's not approved by some of the mods."
Reddit;Am I the only one who thinks the Mbappè/Real Madrid was a lot more complicated than people make it out to be.;KazamaShintaro7;2022/12/31;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zzgndp/am_i_the_only_one_who_thinks_the_mbappèreal/;From what i’ve seen a lot of people think that he turned down Madrid purely for the money. But based Mbappé’s history prior to that transfer suggested he was a person who stuck to his morals and to a degree he still does.We’re talking about a guy who refused to be in commercials for the French team because of what they promoted. I.e Fast Food, Gambling etc. He also hid the Heineken logo from his man of the match trophies. Real Madrid apparently didn’t allow him as much control over his image rights.The biggest think I want to talk about though is the politics involved… he received calls from people like Nicolas Sarkozy (Former French President) and Macron (Current President) urging him to stay. He is the pride and joy of France and probably their most talented player since Zidane. I can only imagine the pressure that he had not only from his nation but from country leaders themselves. It’s a lot for a guy who was only 23 at the time. I think the money could have been part of it but it’s an oversimplification at the same time.

Messi was just huge in this WC. The Mexico game changed everything for Argentina.Mbappè between his performances vs Real Madrid in 2022 (even if he lost) and the composure to hit those two penalties in arguably the most high pressure situations i’ve seen for a footballer was just amazing and that volley was simply *chefs kiss* can’t think of any 23 year old player who could perform do THAT under such circumstances.Modric I would also say truly has ice in his veins.

I highly doubt that if he chose to stay in Europe that he would achieve anything significant, also I don't think he would be a starter at a top club and I don't think he would settle for that.  Also how would his move damage in anyway his legacy? 5 Ballon Dors, 5 CLs, 4 golden shoes, Euro Cup, and countless other trophies and records. LOL what is there left for him to prove at age 38?And also just so you know, Pele decided to move to MLS at 35 yo, and as you see his legacy is fine.Edit: I understand that his European career didn't end as nicely as he would want to. Since he left Madrid he was playing mostly for himself without committing to anyone, and once it got rocky both in Juve and MU he ran to the door. But that's CR7 for you, always has been.

Reddit;European football fans have the shortest memories of all sports fans.;cemma2035;2022/12/31;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zzisjt/european_football_fans_have_the_shortest_memories/;It absolutely pains me to have witnessed how you all treated Ronaldo this last year. Man had 1 subpar season and you totally disregard the last 2 decades of pure quality that he gave the sport.You may have forgotten but here in Africa (and I'm sure Asia and Middle East as well), we still remember that he is one of the greatest players to every kick a football. You're so spoiled having these greats in your backyard that you so easily disregard them. And the audacity to feel betrayed when he decides to follow the money instead of jumping through hoops to please you as he's met with nothing but disrespect.I'm happy for Saudi Arabian fans who get to witness first hand the final days of a wonderful career and I'm happy for Ronaldo who can once again play in front of cheering fans and media that actually want to see him succeed.Can't wait to see who you'll betray next? If you can even turn your backs on a 5 time Ballon d'Or winner, is anyone safe?
Reddit;Ronaldo move to Saudi Arabia is the medias fault.;Marktheshark455;2022/12/31;https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/zzsrd7/ronaldo_move_to_saudi_arabia_is_the_medias_fault/;This might be a little rant, but just bare with me. Why are people so shocked that Ronaldo took the Cash bag and went Saudi Arabia. Has anyone been paying attention to how the media has attacked this man this past year? Do I agree with everything Ronaldo has done these past couple months, no. But we are talking about one of , if not the greatest players to ever live, and the respect shown to this man has been a complete joke. Does anyone here actually believe that a player who scored a hattrick earlier this year against spurs is finished. His son died, anyone who experienced that before knows it’s not easy to recover from. The club he gave his everything for didn’t believe him when his own daughter was sick. The media started this narrative that he was finished and a problem for Manchester United when he was banging hattricks. Top scorer on the team, and they took advantage of it when he lost his son. I don’t think Ronaldo wanted to go Saudi Arabia, but believe me if he went Chelsea or Bayern, the media will continue attacking him saying he shouldn’t start. Ronaldo probably just wanted peace and decided to give everyone the middle finger and dip , I don’t blame him. We don’t deserve him. I don’t care if you’re a Messi fan , anyone who doesn’t see the brilliance of this man and what he gave to the sport , should stop watching soccer. Ronaldo is the most hated athlete because he’s the most successful and I have so much respect for him how he was able to deal with media ,fifa all these years against him. Michael Jordan said if he played today he wouldn’t survive playing because of the media for his mental health. Imagine Ronaldo.
ArXiv;Predicting football tables by a maximally parsimonious model;Kjetil Haugen, Brynjulf Owren;2018/05/23;http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08937v1;This paper presents some useful mathematical results involved in footballtable prediction. In addition, some empirical results indicate that analternative methodology for football table prediction may produce high qualityforecasts with far less resource usage than conventional methods.
ArXiv;Network analysis of the worldwide footballer transfer market;Ming-Xia Li, Wei-Xing Zhou, H. Eugene Stanley;2018/11/01;http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00300v1;The transfer of football players is an important part in football games. Moststudies on the transfer of football players focus on the transfer system andtransfer fees but not on the transfer behavior itself. Based on the 470,792transfer records from 1990 to 2016 among 23,605 football clubs in 206 countriesand regions, we construct a directed footballer transfer network (FTN), wherethe nodes are the football clubs and the links correspond to the footballertransfers. A systemic analysis is conduced on the topological properties of theFTN. We find that the in-degrees, out-degrees, in-strengths and out-strengthsof nodes follow bimodal distributions (a power law with exponential decay),while the distribution of link weights has a power-law tail. We further figureout the correlations between node degrees, node strengths and link weights. Wealso investigate the general characteristics of different measures of networkcentrality. Our network analysis of the global footballer transfer market shedsnew lights into the investigation of the characteristics of transferactivities.
ArXiv;Networks of international football: communities, evolution and  globalization of the game;Yang Li, Gonzalo Mateos;2022/05/21;http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10599v1;As the most popular sport around the globe, the game of football has recentlyintrigued much research interest to explore and distill useful and appealinginformation from the sport. Network science and graph-centric methods have beenpreviously applied to study the importance of football players and teams. Inthis paper, for the first time we study the macroscopic evolution of thefootball society from a complex network point of view. Football game recordswithin a time window of over a century were collected and expressed in a graphformat, where participant teams are represented by graph nodes and the gamesbetween them are the graph edges. We carry out community detection and temporalanalysis to reveal the dynamic features and the community structures embeddedwithin the football network, offering the evidence of a continuously expandingfootball society. Spatio-temporal analysis is also implemented to unveil thetemporal states that represent distinct development stages in the footballhistory. Our analysis suggests that the evolution of the game receivesconsiderable impact not only from major sport events, but also from multiplesocial and political incidents. The game of football and its evolution reflectsignificant historical transitions and turning points, and can provide a novelperspective for the study of the worldwide globalization process.
ArXiv;The classification of football patterns;V. Braungart, D. Kotschick;2006/06/08;http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0606193v1;We prove that every spherical football (also known as a spherical soccerball) is a branched cover, branched only in the vertices, of the standardfootball made up of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons. We also give examples showingthat the corresponding result is not true for footballs of higher genera.Moreover, we classify the possible pairs (k,l) for which football patterns onthe sphere exist satisfying a natural generalisation of the usual incidencerelation between pentagons and hexagons to k-gons and l-gons.

Rubinstein, Kewei Zhang;2019/05/02;http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00865v1;Compact Ricci solitons on surfaces have at most two cone points, and areknown as Hamilton's footballs. In this note we completely describe thedegenerations of these footballs as one or both of the cone angles approacheszero. In particular, we show that Hamilton's famous non-compact cigar solitonis the Gromov--Hausdorff limit of Hamilton's compact conical teardrop solitons.
ArXiv;Seasonal Linear Predictivity in National Football Championships;Giuseppe Jurman;2015/11/19;http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06262v1;Predicting the results of sport matches and competitions is an arisingresearch field, benefiting from the growing amount of available data and thenovel data analytics techniques. Excellent forecasts can be achieved byadvanced machine learning methods applied to detailed historical data,especially in very popular sports such as football (soccer). Here we show that,despite the large number of confounding factors, the results of a football teamin longer competitions (e.g., a national league) follow a basically lineartrend useful for predictive purposes, too. In support of this claim, we presenta set of experiments of linear regression on a database collecting the yearlyresults of 707 teams playing in 22 divisions from 11 countries, in 20 footballseasons.
ArXiv;Pricing Football Players using Neural Networks;Sourya Dey;2017/11/16;http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05865v2;We designed a multilayer perceptron neural network to predict the price of afootball (soccer) player using data on more than 15,000 players from thefootball simulation video game FIFA 2017. The network was optimized byexperimenting with different activation functions, number of neurons andlayers, learning rate and its decay, Nesterov momentum based stochasticgradient descent, L2 regularization, and early stopping. Simultaneousexploration of various aspects of neural network training is performed andtheir trade-offs are investigated. Our final model achieves a top-5 accuracy of87.2% among 119 pricing categories, and places any footballer within 6.32% ofhis actual price on average.
ArXiv;Predictive modelling of football injuries;Stylianos Kampakis;2016/09/20;http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07480v1;The goal of this thesis is to investigate the potential of predictivemodelling for football injuries. This work was conducted in close collaborationwith Tottenham Hotspurs FC (THFC), the PGA European tour and the participationof Wolverhampton Wanderers (WW).  Three investigations were conducted:  1. Predicting the recovery time of football injuries using the UEFA injuryrecordings: The UEFA recordings is a common standard for recording injuries inprofessional football. For this investigation, three datasets of UEFA injuryrecordings were available. Different machine learning algorithms were used inorder to build a predictive model. The performance of the machine learningmodels is then improved by using feature selection conducted throughcorrelation-based subset feature selection and random forests.  2. Predicting injuries in professional football using exposure records: Therelationship between exposure (in training hours and match hours) inprofessional football athletes and injury incidence was studied. A commonproblem in football is understanding how the training schedule of an athletecan affect the chance of him getting injured. The task was to predict thenumber of days a player can train before he gets injured.  3. Predicting intrinsic injury incidence using in-training GPS measurements:A significant percentage of football injuries can be attributed to overtrainingand fatigue. GPS data collected during training sessions might provideindicators of fatigue, or might be used to detect very intense trainingsessions which can lead to overtraining. This research used GPS data gatheredduring training sessions of the first team of THFC, in order to predict whetheran injury would take place during a week.
ArXiv;Explaining the difference between men's and women's football;Luca Pappalardo, Alessio Rossi, Giuseppe Pontillo, Michela Natilli, Paolo Cintia;2021/01/05;http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01662v1;Women's football is gaining supporters and practitioners worldwide, raisingquestions about what the differences are with men's football. While the twosports are often compared based on the players' physical attributes, we analyzethe spatio-temporal events during matches in the last World Cups to comparemale and female teams based on their technical performance. We train anartificial intelligence model to recognize if a team is male or female based onvariables that describe a match's playing intensity, accuracy, and performancequality. Our model accurately distinguishes between men's and women's football,revealing crucial technical differences, which we investigate through theextraction of explanations from the classifier's decisions. The differencesbetween men's and women's football are rooted in play accuracy, the recoverytime of ball possession, and the players' performance quality. Our methodologymay help journalists and fans understand what makes women's football a distinctsport and coaches design tactics tailored to female teams.
ArXiv;How does AI play football? An analysis of RL and real-world football  strategies;Atom Scott, Keisuke Fujii, Masaki Onishi;2021/11/24;http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12340v1;Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have made it possible todevelop sophisticated agents that excel in a wide range of applications.Simulations using such agents can provide valuable information in scenariosthat are difficult to scientifically experiment in the real world. In thispaper, we examine the play-style characteristics of football RL agents anduncover how strategies may develop during training. The learnt strategies arethen compared with those of real football players. We explore what can belearnt from the use of simulated environments by using aggregated statisticsand social network analysis (SNA). As a result, we found that (1) there arestrong correlations between the competitiveness of an agent and various SNAmetrics and (2) aspects of the RL agents play style become similar to realworld footballers as the agent becomes more competitive. We discuss furtheradvances that may be necessary to improve our understanding necessary to fullyutilise RL for the analysis of football.
ArXiv;Machine Learning Modeling to Evaluate the Value of Football Players;Chenyao Li, Stylianos Kampakis, Philip Treleaven;2022/07/22;http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11361v1;In most sports, especially football, most coaches and analysts search for keyperformance indicators using notational analysis. This method utilizes astatistical summary of events based on video footage and numerical records ofgoal scores. Unfortunately, this approach is now obsolete owing to thecontinuous evolutionary increase in technology that simplifies the analysis ofmore complex process variables through machine learning (ML). Machine learning,a form of artificial intelligence (AI), uses algorithms to detect meaningfulpatterns and define a structure based on positional data. This researchinvestigates a new method to evaluate the value of current football players,based on establishing the machine learning models to investigate the relationsamong the various features of players, the salary of players, and the marketvalue of players. The data of the football players used for this project isfrom several football websites. The data on the salary of football players willbe the proxy for evaluating the value of players, and other features will beused to establish and train the ML model for predicting the suitable salary forthe players. The motivation is to explore what are the relations betweendifferent features of football players and their salaries - how each featureaffects their salaries, or which are the most important features to affect thesalary? Although many standards can reflect the value of football players, thesalary of the players is one of the most intuitive and crucial indexes, so thisstudy will use the salary of players as the proxy to evaluate their value.Moreover, many features of players can affect the valuation of the footballplayers, but the value of players is mainly decided by three types of factors:basic characteristics, performance on the court, and achievements at the club.
ArXiv;On the flight of an American Football;Curtis Horn, Heidi Fearn;2007/06/04;http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0366v1;In this paper we examine the detailed theory of the American football inflight, with spin and air resistance included. We find the theory has much incommon with the theory of a gyroscope and also rocket trajectory with amisaligned thruster. Unfortunately most of the air resistance data, forrocketry and ballistics, is for speeds of Mach 1 or higher, where the airresistance increases dramatically. We shall approximate a realistic airresistance, at the slower speeds of football flight, with a drag forceproportional to cross sectional area and either $v$ or $v^2$, depending onspeed, where $v$ is velocity of the football. We begin with a discussion of themotion, giving as much detail as possible without the use of complex analyticcalculations. We point out the previous errors made with moments of inertia andmake the necessary corrections for more accurate results. We show that theshape of an American football closely resembles a parabola of revolution.
ArXiv;Using Twitter to predict football outcomes;Stylianos Kampakis, Andreas Adamides;2014/11/05;http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1243v1;Twitter has been proven to be a notable source for predictive modelling onvarious domains such as the stock market, the dissemination of diseases orsports outcomes. However, such a study has not been conducted in football(soccer) so far. The purpose of this research was to study whether data minedfrom Twitter can be used for this purpose. We built a set of predictive modelsfor the outcome of football games of the English Premier League for a 3 monthperiod based on tweets and we studied whether these models can overcomepredictive models which use only historical data and simple footballstatistics. Moreover, combined models are constructed using both Twitter andhistorical data. The final results indicate that data mined from Twitter canindeed be a useful source for predicting games in the Premier League. The finalTwitter-based model performs significantly better than chance when measured byCohen's kappa and is comparable to the model that uses simple statistics andhistorical data. Combining both models raises the performance higher than itwas achieved by each individual model. Thereby, this study provides evidencethat Twitter derived features can indeed provide useful information for theprediction of football (soccer) outcomes.

We introducethe Google Research Football Environment, a new reinforcement learningenvironment where agents are trained to play football in an advanced,physics-based 3D simulator. The resulting environment is challenging, easy touse and customize, and it is available under a permissive open-source license.In addition, it provides support for multiplayer and multi-agent experiments.We propose three full-game scenarios of varying difficulty with the FootballBenchmarks and report baseline results for three commonly used reinforcementalgorithms (IMPALA, PPO, and Ape-X DQN). We also provide a diverse set ofsimpler scenarios with the Football Academy and showcase several promisingresearch directions.
ArXiv;A mathematical take on the competitive balance of a football league;Soudeep Deb;2021/02/18;http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09288v1;Competitive balance in a football league is extremely important from theperspective of economic growth of the industry. Many researchers have earlierproposed different measures of competitive balance, which are primarily adaptedfrom the standard economic theory. However, these measures fail to capture thefiner nuances of the game. In this work, we discuss a new framework which ismore suitable for a football league. First, we present a mathematical proof ofan ideal situation where a football league becomes perfectly balanced. Next, agoal based index for competitive balance is developed. We present relevanttheoretical results and show how the proposed index can be used to formallytest for the presence of imbalance. The methods are implemented on the datafrom top five European leagues, and it shows that the new approach can betterexplain the changes in the seasonal competitive balance of the leagues.Further, using appropriate panel data models, we show that the proposed indexis more suitable to analyze the variability in total revenues of the footballleagues.
ArXiv;Stochastic model for football's collective dynamics;A. Chacoma, N. Almeira, J. I. Perotti, O. V. Billoni;2021/04/20;http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10272v2;In this paper, we study collective interaction dynamics emerging in the gameof football-soccer. To do so, we surveyed a database containing body-sensorstraces measured during three professional football matches, where we observedstatistical patterns that we used to propose a stochastic model for theplayers' motion in the field. The model, which is based on linear interactions,captures in good approximation the spatiotemporal dynamics of a football team.Our theoretical framework, therefore, becomes an effective analytical tool touncover the underlying cooperative mechanisms behind the complexity of footballplays. Moreover, we showed that it can provide handy theoretical support forcoaches to evaluate teams' and players' performances in both training sessionsand competitive scenarios.
ArXiv;A Bayesian Mean-Value Approach with a Self-Consistently Determined Prior  Distribution for the Ranking of College Football Teams;James R. Ashburn, Paul M. Colvert;2006/07/07;http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0607064v2;We introduce a Bayesian mean-value approach for ranking all college footballteams using only win-loss data. This approach is unique in that the priordistribution necessary to handle undefeated and winless teams is calculatedself-consistently. Furthermore, we will show statistics supporting the validityof the prior distribution. Finally, a brief comparison with other footballrankings will be presented.
ArXiv;Statistics of football dynamics;R. S. Mendes, L. C. Malacarne, C. Anteneodo;2007/06/12;http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1758v1;We investigate the dynamics of football matches. Our goal is to characterizestatistically the temporal sequence of ball movements in this collective sportgame, searching for traits of complex behavior. Data were collected over avariety of matches in South American, European and World championshipsthroughout 2005 and 2006. We show that the statistics of ball touches presentspower-law tails and can be described by $q$-gamma distributions. To explainsuch behavior we propose a model that provides information on thecharacteristics of football dynamics. Furthermore, we discuss the statistics ofduration of out-of-play intervals, not directly related to the previousscenario.
ArXiv;Comparing probabilistic predictive models applied to football;Marcio A. Diniz, Rafael Izbicki, Danilo Lopes, Luis Ernesto Salasar;2017/05/11;http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04356v1;We propose two Bayesian multinomial-Dirichlet models to predict the finaloutcome of football (soccer) matches and compare them to three well-knownmodels regarding their predictive power. All the models predicted the full-timeresults of 1710 matches of the first division of the Brazilian footballchampionship and the comparison used three proper scoring rules, the proportionof errors and a calibration assessment. We also provide a goodness of fitmeasure. Our results show that multinomial-Dirichlet models are not onlycompetitive with standard approaches, but they are also well calibrated andpresent reasonable goodness of fit.
ArXiv;Combining historical data and bookmakers'odds in modelling football  scores;Leonardo Egidi, Francesco Pauli, Nicola Torelli;2018/02/24;http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08848v1;Modelling football outcomes has gained increasing attention, in large partdue to the potential for making substantial profits. Despite the strongconnection existing between football models and the bookmakers' betting odds,no authors have used the latter for improving the fit and the predictiveaccuracy of these models. We have developed a hierarchical Bayesian Poissonmodel in which the scoring rates of the teams are convex combinations ofparameters estimated from historical data and the additional source of thebetting odds. We apply our analysis to a nine-year dataset of the most popularEuropean leagues in order to predict match outcomes for their tenth seasons. Inthis paper, we provide numerical and graphical checks for our model.
ArXiv;Distinguishing Between Roles of Football Players in Play-by-play Match  Event Data;Bart Aalbers, Jan Van Haaren;2018/09/13;http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05173v1;Over the last few decades, the player recruitment process in professionalfootball has evolved into a multi-billion industry and has thus become of vitalimportance. To gain insights into the general level of their candidatereinforcements, many professional football clubs have access to extensive videofootage and advanced statistics. However, the question whether a given playerwould fit the team's playing style often still remains unanswered. In thispaper, we aim to bridge that gap by proposing a set of 21 player roles andintroducing a method for automatically identifying the most applicable rolesfor each player from play-by-play event data collected during matches.

Models forestimating these are presented and compared. These, along with other predictorsare introduced into two Bayesian approaches for the final estimate of in-gamehome-team win probability. To illustrate utility, methods are applied to the2021 Big XII Conference Football Championship game between Baylor and OklahomaState.
ArXiv;nflWAR: A Reproducible Method for Offensive Player Evaluation in  Football;Ronald Yurko, Samuel Ventura, Maksim Horowitz;2018/02/03;http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00998v2;Unlike other major professional sports, American football lacks comprehensivestatistical ratings for player evaluation that are both reproducible and easilyinterpretable in terms of game outcomes. Existing methods for player evaluationin football depend heavily on proprietary data, are not reproducible, and lagbehind those of other major sports. We present four contributions to the studyof football statistics in order to address these issues. First, we develop theR package nflscrapR to provide easy access to publicly available play-by-playdata from the National Football League (NFL) dating back to 2009. Second, weintroduce a novel multinomial logistic regression approach for estimating theexpected points for each play. Third, we use the expected points as input intoa generalized additive model for estimating the win probability for each play.Fourth, we introduce our nflWAR framework, using multilevel models to isolatethe contributions of individual offensive skill players, and providingestimates for their individual wins above replacement (WAR). We estimate theuncertainty in each player's WAR through a resampling approach specificallydesigned for football, and we present these results for the 2017 NFL season. Wediscuss how our reproducible WAR framework, built entirely on publiclyavailable data, can be easily extended to estimate WAR for players at anyposition, provided that researchers have access to data specifying whichplayers are on the field during each play. Finally, we discuss the potentialimplications of this work for NFL teams.
ArXiv;Going Deep: Models for Continuous-Time Within-Play Valuation of Game  Outcomes in American Football with Tracking Data;Ronald Yurko, Francesca Matano, Lee F. Richardson, Nicholas Granered, Taylor Pospisil, Konstantinos Pelechrinis, Samuel L. Ventura;2019/06/05;http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01760v3;Continuous-time assessments of game outcomes in sports have becomeincreasingly common in the last decade. In American football, onlydiscrete-time estimates of play value were possible, since the most advancedpublic football datasets were recorded at the play-by-play level. Whilemeasures such as expected points and win probability are useful for evaluatingfootball plays and game situations, there has been no research into how thesevalues change throughout the course of a play. In this work, we make two maincontributions: First, we introduce a general framework for continuous-timewithin-play valuation in the National Football League using player-trackingdata. Our modular framework incorporates several modular sub-models, to easilyincorporate recent work involving player tracking data in football. Second, weuse a long short-term memory recurrent neural network to construct aball-carrier model to estimate how many yards the ball-carrier is expected togain from their current position, conditional on the locations and trajectoriesof the ball-carrier, their teammates and opponents. Additionally, wedemonstrate an extension with conditional density estimation so that theexpectation of any measure of play value can be calculated in continuous-time,which was never before possible at such a granular level.
ArXiv;Protocol for an Observational Study of the Association of High School  Football Participation on Health in Late Adulthood;Timothy G. Gaulton, Sameer K. Deshpande, Dylan S. Small, Mark D. Neuman;2019/02/26;http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10106v1;American football is the most popular high school sport and is among theleading cause of injury among adolescents. While there has been considerablerecent attention on the link between football and cognitive decline, there isalso evidence of higher than expected rates of pain, obesity, and lower qualityof life among former professional players, either as a result of repetitivehead injury or through different mechanisms. Previously hidden downstreameffects of playing football may have far-reaching public health implicationsfor participants in youth and high school football programs.  Our proposed study is a retrospective observational study that compares 1,153high school males who played varsity football with 2,751 male students who didnot. 1,951 of the control subjects did not play any sport and the remaining 800controls played a non-contact sport. Our primary outcome is self-rated healthmeasured at age 65. To control for potential confounders, we adjust forpre-exposure covariates with matching and model-based covariance adjustment. Wewill conduct an ordered testing procedure designed to use the full pool of2,751 controls while also controlling for possible unmeasured differencesbetween students who played sports and those who did not. We willquantitatively assess the sensitivity of the results to potential unmeasuredconfounding. The study will also assess secondary outcomes of pain, difficultywith activities of daily living, and obesity, as these are both important toindividual well-being and have public health relevance.
ArXiv;FootApp: an AI-Powered System for Football Match Annotation;Silvio Barra, Salvatore M. Carta, Alessandro Giuliani, Alessia Pisu, Alessandro Sebastian Podda, DanieleRiboni;2021/03/04;http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02938v1;In the last years, scientific and industrial research has experienced agrowing interest in acquiring large annotated data sets to train artificialintelligence algorithms for tackling problems in different domains. In thiscontext, we have observed that even the market for football data hassubstantially grown. The analysis of football matches relies on the annotationof both individual players' and team actions, as well as the athleticperformance of players. Consequently, annotating football events at afine-grained level is a very expensive and error-prone task. Most existingsemi-automatic tools for football match annotation rely on cameras and computervision. However, those tools fall short in capturing team dynamics, and inextracting data of players who are not visible in the camera frame. To addressthese issues, in this manuscript we present FootApp, an AI-based system forfootball match annotation. First, our system relies on an advanced and mixeduser interface that exploits both vocal and touch interaction. Second, themotor performance of players is captured and processed by applying machinelearning algorithms to data collected from inertial sensors worn by players.Artificial intelligence techniques are then used to check the consistency ofgenerated labels, including those regarding the physical activity of players,to automatically recognize annotation errors. Notably, we implemented a fullprototype of the proposed system, performing experiments to show itseffectiveness in a real-world adoption scenario.
ArXiv;Deep Learning-based Automatic Player Identification and Logging in  American Football Videos;Hongshan Liu, Colin Aderon, Noah Wagon, Huapu Liu, Steven MacCall, Yu Gan;2022/04/26;http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13809v1;American football games attract significant worldwide attention every year.Game analysis systems generate crucial information that can help analyze thegames by providing fans and coaches with a convenient means to track andevaluate player performance. Identifying participating players in each play isalso important for the video indexing of player participation per play.Processing football game video presents challenges such as crowded setting,distorted objects, and imbalanced data for identifying players, especiallyjersey numbers. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based football videoanalysis system to automatically track players and index their participationper play. It is a multi-stage network design to highlight area of interest andidentify jersey number information with high accuracy. First, we utilize anobject detection network, a detection transformer, to tackle the playerdetection problem in crowded context. Second, we identify players using jerseynumber recognition with a secondary convolutional neural network, thensynchronize it with a game clock subsystem. Finally, the system outputs acomplete log in a database for play indexing. We demonstrate the effectivenessand reliability of player identification and the logging system by analyzingthe qualitative and quantitative results on football videos. The proposedsystem shows great potential for implementation in and analysis of footballbroadcast video.

ArXiv;Fantasy Football Prediction;Roman Lutz;2015/05/26;http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06918v1;The ubiquity of professional sports and specifically the NFL have lead to anincrease in popularity for Fantasy Football. Users have many tools at theirdisposal: statistics, predictions, rankings of experts and even recommendationsof peers. There are issues with all of these, though. Especially since manypeople pay money to play, the prediction tools should be enhanced as theyprovide unbiased and easy-to-use assistance for users. This paper provides anddiscusses approaches to predict Fantasy Football scores of Quarterbacks withrelatively limited data. In addition to that, it includes several suggestionson how the data could be enhanced to achieve better results. The datasetconsists only of game data from the last six NFL seasons.

We do so using only the thirty-year record of whichvisiting teams played which home teams, on what date, and what the final scorewas. No real ""statistics"" are used. The method works best in basketball, likelybecause it is high-scoring and has long seasons. It works better in footballand hockey than in baseball, but in baseball the predictions are closer to atheoretical optimum. The football predictions, while good, can in principle bemade much better, and the hockey predictions can be made somewhat better. Thesefindings tells us that in basketball, most statistics are subsumed by thescores of the games, whereas in football, further study of game and playerstatistics is necessary to predict games as well as can be done. Baseball andhockey lie somewhere in between."

To get meaningful results, we performdifferent network analysis methods on our networks. Our approach based onPageRank reveals Christiano Ronaldo as the top player. Using a variation ofbetweenness centrality, we identify Standard Liege as the best springboardclub.
ArXiv;Rating evaluation of sports development efficiency using statistical  analysis: evidence from Russian football;Ilya Solntsev, Anatoly Vorobyev, Elnura Irmatova, Nikita Osokin;2016/12/22;http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07543v1;Increasing investments into various dimensions of sports draw a significantamount of attention to the way these resources are being managed and whichorganizations achieve development goals with higher efficiency. This paperreviews the methodology of designing an efficiency rating model for assessingsports entities, focusing on the experience of Russian football. The RussianRegional Efficiency of Football Development model aims to evaluate the regionalfederations of the Football Union of Russian via 5 dimensions. The scoringmethod of the model is based on the three-sigma rule of distribution. Supportfactors in the form of population density and climate were also included, sinceRussian regions significantly differentiate in these aspects. The findings ofthis paper showcased that not a single region was able to achieve a maximum 5-star rating, while regions set to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup did not scorebetter compared to others. In conclusion the authors provide varioussuggestions on further developing and implementing rating models within globalsports organizations.

Priorstudies based on small datasets and manual coding show that such theatricsevince commentator bias in sports broadcasts. To examine this phenomenon, weassemble FOOTBALL, which contains 1,455 broadcast transcripts from Americanfootball games across six decades that are automatically annotated with 250Kplayer mentions and linked with racial metadata. We identify major confoundingfactors for researchers examining racial bias in FOOTBALL, and perform acomputational analysis that supports conclusions from prior social sciencestudies.
ArXiv;Maximizing performance with an eye on the finances: a chance-constrained  model for football transfer market decisions;Giovanni Pantuso, Lars Magnus Hvattum;2019/11/10;http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04689v2;Composing a team of professional players is among the most crucial decisionsin association football. Nevertheless, transfer market decisions are oftenbased on myopic objectives and are questionable from a financial point of view.This paper introduces a chance-constrained model to provide analytic support toclub managers during transfer windows. The model seeks a top-performing teamwhile adapting to different budgets and financial-risk profiles. In addition,it provides a new rating system that is able to numerically reflect theon-field performance of football players and thus contribute to an objectiveassessment of football players. The model and rating system are tested on acase study based on real market data. The data from the case study areavailable online for the benefit of future research.
ArXiv;Football tracking networks: Beyond event-based connectivity;J. M. Buldu, D. Garrido, D. R. Antequera, J. Busquets, E. Estrada, R. Resta, R. Lopez del Campo;2020/11/11;http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06014v1;We propose using Network Science as a complementary tool to analyze playerand team behavior during a football match. Specifically, we introduce fourkinds of networks based on different ways of interaction between players. Ourapproach's main novelty is to use tracking datasets to create football trackingnetworks, instead of constructing and analyzing the traditional networks basedon events. In this way, we are able to capture player interactions that gobeyond passes and introduce the concepts of (a) Ball Flow Networks, (b) MarkingNetworks, (c) Signed Proximity Networks and (d) Functional CoordinationNetworks. After defining the methodology for creating each kind of network, weshow some examples using tracking datasets from four different matches ofLaLiga Santander. Finally, we discuss some of the applications, limitations,and further improvements of football tracking networks.

Beggs;2021/04/20;http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10125v1;We use European football performance data to select teams to form theproposed European football Super League, using only unsupervised techniques. Wefirst used random forest regression to select important variables predictinggoal difference, which we used to calculate the Euclidian distances betweenteams. Creating a Laplacian eigenmap, we bisected the Fielder vector toidentify the five major European football leagues' natural clusters. Ourresults showed how an unsupervised approach could successfully identify fourclusters based on five basic performance metrics: shots, shots on target, shotsconceded, possession, and pass success. The top two clusters identify thoseteams who dominate their respective leagues and are the best candidates tocreate the most competitive elite super league.
ArXiv;Partially Constrained Group Variable Selection to Adjust for  Complementary Unit Performance in American College Football;Andrey Skripnikov;2022/10/22;http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12519v1;Given the importance of accurate team rankings in American college football(CFB) -- due to heavy title and playoff implications -- strides have been madeto improve evaluation metrics across statistical categories, going from basicaverages (e.g. points scored per game) to metrics that adjust for a team'sstrength of schedule, but one aspect that hasn't been emphasized is thecomplementary nature of American football. Despite the same team's offensiveand defensive units typically consisting of separate player sets, some aspectsof your team's defensive (offensive) performance may affect the complementaryside: turnovers forced by your defense could lead to easier scoring chances foryour offense, while your offense's ability to control the clock may help yourdefense. For 2009-2019 CFB seasons, we incorporate natural splines with grouppenalty approaches to identify the most consistently influential features ofcomplementary football in a data-driven way, conducting partially constrainedoptimization in order to additionally guarantee the full adjustment forstrength of schedule and homefield factor. We touch on the issues arising dueto reverse-causal nature of certain within-game dynamics, discussing severalpotential remedies. Lastly, game outcome prediction performances are comparedacross several ranking adjustment approaches for method validation purposes.

Which players should you draft for your team? We investigated thisquestion using the wealth of data available from fantasy premier leaguefootball (soccer). Using the players' data from past seasons, for severalseasons and several different budget constraints, we identified the highestscoring fantasy team for each season subject to each budget constraint. We theninvestigated quantifiable characteristics of these teams. Interesting, acrossnearly every variable that is significant to the game of football and thebudget, these top teams display diversity across these variables. Our resultsindicate that diversity is a general feature of top performing teams.

Therefore, it is very important toidentify the right parameters to monitor to predict market value. The followingpaper aims at determining the relevant features that successfully forecastfuture value for football players. Success is measured against their marketvalue from TransferMarkt. To select prominent features, we use Lassoregressions and Random Forest algorithms. Some obvious variables are selectedbut we also observe some subtle dependencies between features and future marketvalue. Finally, we rank the Golden Boy nominees using our forecasts and showour methodology can successfully compare football players based on theirquality.
ArXiv;Football fever: goal distributions and non-Gaussian statistics;Elmar Bittner, Andreas Nussbaumer, Wolfhard Janke, Martin Weigel;2006/06/01;http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0606016v1;Analyzing football score data with statistical techniques, we investigate howthe not purely random, but highly co-operative nature of the game is reflectedin averaged properties such as the probability distributions of scored goalsfor the home and away teams. As it turns out, especially the tails of thedistributions are not well described by the Poissonian or binomial modelresulting from the assumption of uncorrelated random events. Instead, a goodeffective description of the data is provided by less basic distributions suchas the negative binomial one or the probability densities of extreme valuestatistics. To understand this behavior from a microscopical point of view,however, no waiting time problem or extremal process need be invoked. Instead,modifying the Bernoulli random process underlying the Poissonian model toinclude a simple component of self-affirmation seems to describe the datasurprisingly well and allows to understand the observed deviation from Gaussianstatistics. The phenomenological distributions used before can be understood asspecial cases within this framework. We analyzed historical football score datafrom many leagues in Europe as well as from international tournaments,including data from all past tournaments of the ``FIFA World Cup'' series, andfound the proposed models to be applicable rather universally. In particular,here we analyse the results of the German women's premier football league andconsider the two separate German men's premier leagues in the East and Westduring the cold war times and the unified league after 1990 to see how scoringin football and the component of self-affirmation depend on cultural andpolitical circumstances.
ArXiv;Which Football Player Bears Most Resemblance to Messi? A Statistical  Analysis;Jiri Mazurek;2018/02/03;http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00967v1;Many pundits and fans ask themselves the same question: Which football playerbears most resemblance to Lionel Messi? Is it Chelsea's Eden Hazard? Is itPaulo Dybala, the heir to Messi in the national team of Argentina? Or is themost alike player to Messi someone completely else? In general, the research onthe evaluation of players' performances originated in the context of baseballin the USA, but, currently, it is of great importance in almost every teamsport on the planet. Specifically, football clubs' managers can use the data onplayer's similarity when looking for replacement of their players by other,presumably similar ones. Also, the research in the presented direction iscertainly interesting both for football pundits and football fans. Therefore,the aim of this study is to answer the question from the title with the use ofthe statistical analysis based on the data from ongoing league season retrievedfrom WhoScored (WS) database. WS provides detailed data (up to 24 parameterssuch as goals scored, the number of assists, shots on goal, passes, dribbles orfouls) for players of TOP 5 European leagues, and ranks them with respect totheir overall performance. For this study, 17 parameters (criteria) mostrelevant for an attacking player were used, and a set of 28 players, candidatesto be 'most alike to Messi' from WS TOP 100 list were selected. After datanormalization and application of a proper metric function the most similarplayer to Lionel Messi was found.

On the one hand, playing football has become a high-incomeprofession and the players are highly motivated; on the other hand, strongerteams have higher incomes and therefore afford better players leading to aneven stronger appearance in tournaments that can make the game more imbalancedand hence predictable. To quantify and document this observation, in this workwe take a minimalist network science approach to measure the predictability offootball over 26 years in major European leagues. We show that over time, thegames in major leagues have indeed become more predictable. We provide furthersupport for this observation by showing that inequality between teams hasincreased and the home-field advantage has been vanishing ubiquitously. We donot include any direct analysis on the effects of monetization on football'spredictability or therefore, lack of excitement, however, we propose severalhypotheses which could be tested in future analyses."
ArXiv;Genre determining prediction: Non-standard TAM marking in football  language;Jakob Egetenmeyer;2021/06/30;http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15872v1;German and French football language display tense-aspect-mood (TAM) formswhich differ from the TAM use in other genres. In German football talk, thepresent indicative may replace the pluperfect subjunctive. In French reports offootball matches, the imperfective past may occur instead of a perfective pasttense-aspect form. We argue that the two phenomena share a functional core andare licensed in the same way, which is a direct result of the genre they occurin. More precisely, football match reports adhere to a precise script andspecific events are temporally determined in terms of objective time. Thisallows speakers to exploit a secondary function of TAM forms, namely, theyshift the temporal perspective. We argue that it is on the grounds of the genrethat comprehenders predict the deviating forms and are also able to decodethem. We present various corpus studies where we explore the functioning ofthese phenomena in order to gain insights into their distribution,grammaticalization and their functioning in discourse. Relevant factors areAktionsart properties, rhetorical relations and their interaction with otherTAM forms. This allows us to discuss coping mechanisms on the part of thecomprehender. We broaden our understanding of the phenomena, which have onlybeen partly covered for French and up to now seem to have been ignored inGerman.

In this work, we propose a deterministic decision tree-basedalgorithm to automatically extract football events using tracking data, whichconsists of two steps: (1) a possession step that evaluates which player was inpossession of the ball at each frame in the tracking data, as well as thedistinct player configurations during the time intervals where the ball is notin play to inform set piece detection; (2) an event detection step thatcombines the changes in ball possession computed in the first step with thelaws of football to determine in-game events and set pieces. The automaticallygenerated events are benchmarked against manually annotated events and we showthat in most event categories the proposed methodology achieves $+90\%$detection rate across different tournaments and tracking data providers.Finally, we demonstrate how the contextual information offered by tracking datacan be leveraged to increase the granularity of auto-detected events, andexhibit how the proposed framework may be used to conduct a myriad of dataanalyses in football."
ArXiv;Graph Neural Network based Agent in Google Research Football;Yizhan Niu, Jinglong Liu, Yuhao Shi, Jiren Zhu;2022/04/23;http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11142v1;Deep neural networks (DNN) can approximate value functions or policies forreinforcement learning, which makes the reinforcement learning algorithms morepowerful. However, some DNNs, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN),cannot extract enough information or take too long to obtain enough featuresfrom the inputs under specific circumstances of reinforcement learning. Forexample, the input data of Google Research Football, a reinforcement learningenvironment which trains agents to play football, is the small map of players'locations. The information is contained not only in the coordinates of players,but also in the relationships between different players. CNNs can neitherextract enough information nor take too long to train. To address this issue,this paper proposes a deep q-learning network (DQN) with a graph neural network(GNN) as its model. The GNN transforms the input data into a graph which betterrepresents the football players' locations so that it extracts more informationof the interactions between different players. With two GNNs to approximate itslocal and target value functions, this DQN allows players to learn from theirexperience by using value functions to see the prospective value of eachintended action. The proposed model demonstrated the power of GNN in thefootball game by outperforming other DRL models with significantly fewer steps.
ArXiv;Explainable expected goal models for performance analysis in football  analytics;Mustafa Cavus, Przemysław Biecek;2022/06/14;http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07212v2;The expected goal provides a more representative measure of the team andplayer performance which also suit the low-scoring nature of football insteadof score in modern football. The score of a match involves randomness and oftenmay not represent the performance of the teams and players, therefore it hasbeen popular to use the alternative statistics in recent years such as shots ontarget, ball possessions, and drills. To measure the probability of a shotbeing a goal by the expected goal, several features are used to train anexpected goal model which is based on the event and tracking football data. Theselection of these features, the size and date of the data, and the model whichare used as the parameters that may affect the performance of the model. Usingblack-box machine learning models for increasing the predictive performance ofthe model decreases its interpretability that causes the loss of informationthat can be gathered from the model. This paper proposes an accurate expectedgoal model trained consisting of 315,430 shots from seven seasons between2014-15 and 2020-21 of the top-five European football leagues. Moreover, thismodel is explained by using explainable artificial intelligence tool to obtainan explainable expected goal model for evaluating a team or player performance.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that demonstrates apractical application of an explainable artificial intelligence tool aggregatedprofiles to explain a group of observations on an accurate expected goal modelfor monitoring the team and player performance. Moreover, these methods can begeneralized to other sports branches.
ArXiv;Protocol for an observational study on the effects of playing football  in adolescence on mental health in early adulthood;Sameer K. Deshpande, Raiden B. Hasegawa, Jordan Weiss, Dylan S. Small;2018/08/12;http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03934v2;More than 1 million students play high school American football annually, butmany health professionals have recently questioned its safety or called for itsban. These concerns have been partially driven by reports of chronic traumaticencephalopathy (CTE), increased risks of neurodegenerative disease, andassociations between concussion history and later-life cognitive impairment anddepression among retired professional football players.  A recent observational study of a cohort of men who graduated from aWisconsin high school in 1957 found no statistically significant harmfuleffects of playing high school football on a range of cognitive, psychological,and socio-economic outcomes measured at ages 35, 54, 65, and 72. Unfortunately,these findings may not generalize to younger populations, thanks to changes andimprovements in football helmet technology and training techniques. Inparticular, these changes may have led to increased perceptions of safety butultimately more dangerous styles of play, characterized by the frequentsub-concussive impacts thought to be associated with later-life neurologicaldecline.  In this work, we replicate the methodology of that earlier matchedobservational study using data from the National Longitudinal Study ofAdolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). These include adolescent and familyco-morbidities, academic experience, self-reported levels of general health andphysical activity, and the score on the Add Health Picture Vocabulary Test. Ourprimary outcome is the CES-D score measured in 2008 when subjects were aged 24-- 34 and settling into early adulthood. We also examine several secondaryoutcomes related to physical and psychological health, including suicidality.Our results can provide insight into the natural history of potentialfootball-related decline and dysfunction.

More recently, AItechniques have been applied to football, due to a huge increase in datacollection by professional teams, increased computational power, and advancesin machine learning, with the goal of better addressing new scientificchallenges involved in the analysis of both individual players' and coordinatedteams' behaviors. The research challenges associated with predictive andprescriptive football analytics require new developments and progress at theintersection of statistical learning, game theory, and computer vision. In thispaper, we provide an overarching perspective highlighting how the combinationof these fields, in particular, forms a unique microcosm for AI research, whileoffering mutual benefits for professional teams, spectators, and broadcastersin the years to come. We illustrate that this duality makes football analyticsa game changer of tremendous value, in terms of not only changing the game offootball itself, but also in terms of what this domain can mean for the fieldof AI. We review the state-of-the-art and exemplify the types of analysisenabled by combining the aforementioned fields, including illustrative examplesof counterfactual analysis using predictive models, and the combination ofgame-theoretic analysis of penalty kicks with statistical learning of playerattributes. We conclude by highlighting envisioned downstream impacts,including possibilities for extensions to other sports (real and virtual).

We prove this convergence in two different ways. Geometrically, theconvergence follows from Luo-Tian's explicit description of conic spheres asboundaries of convex polytopes in $S^{3}$. Analytically, regarding theconformal factors as the singular solutions to the corresponding PDE, we derivethe required a priori estimates and convergence result after properreparametrization.

Our method first clusters formations intoseveral average formations: `442,' `4141,' `433,' `541,' and `343.' Then, eachaverage formation is further divided into more specific patterns in which theconfigurations of players are slightly different. The latter step is based onhierarchical clustering and the Delaunay method, which defines the formation ofa team as an adjacency matrix of Delaunay triangulation. A formation clusteredusing our method is expressed in a form such as `442-C1'.

ArXiv;A copula-based multivariate hidden Markov model for modelling momentum  in football;Marius Ötting, Roland Langrock, Antonello Maruotti;2020/02/04;http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01193v2;"We investigate the potential occurrence of change points - commonly referredto as ""momentum shifts"" - in the dynamics of football matches. For thatpurpose, we model minute-by-minute in-game statistics of Bundesliga matchesusing hidden Markov models (HMMs). To allow for within-state correlation of thevariables considered, we formulate multivariate state-dependent distributionsusing copulas. For the Bundesliga data considered, we find that the fitted HMMscomprise states which can be interpreted as a team showing different levels ofcontrol over a match. Our modelling framework enables inference related tocauses of momentum shifts and team tactics, which is of much interest tomanagers, bookmakers, and sports fans."
ArXiv;The Barrier Surface in the Cooperative Football Differential Game;Eloy Garcia, David W. Casbeer, Meir Pachter;2020/06/05;http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03682v1;This paper considers the blocking or football pursuit-evasion differentialgame. Two pursuers cooperate and try to capture the ball carrying evader as faras possible from the goal line. The evader wishes to be as close as possible tothe goal line at the time of capture and, if possible, reach the line. In thispaper the solution of the game of kind is provided: The Barrier surface thatpartitions the state space into two winning sets, one for the pursuer team andone for the evader, is constructed. Under optimal play, the winning team isdetermined by evaluating the associated Barrier function.
ArXiv;A Reinforcement Learning Based Approach to Play Calling in Football;Preston Biro, Stephen G. Walker;2021/03/11;http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06939v1;With the vast amount of data collected on football and the growth ofcomputing abilities, many games involving decision choices can be optimized.The underlying rule is the maximization of an expected utility of outcomes andthe law of large numbers. The data available allows us to compute with highaccuracy the probabilities of outcomes of decisions and the well defined pointssystem in the game allows us to have the necessary terminal utilities. Withsome well established theory we can then optimize choices at a single playlevel.
ArXiv;Football Group Draw Probabilities and Corrections;Gareth O. Roberts, Jeffrey S. Rosenthal;2022/05/12;http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06578v1;This paper considers the challenge of designing football group drawmechanisms which have the uniform distribution over all valid draw assignments,but are also entertaining, practical, and transparent. We explain how tosimulate the FIFA Sequential Draw method, to compute the non-uniformity of itsdraws by comparison to a uniform Rejection Sampler. We then propose twopractical methods of achieving the uniform distribution while still using ballsand bowls in a way which is suitable for a televised draw. The solutions canalso be tried interactively.

ArXiv;Defining a historic football team: Using Network Science to analyze  Guardiola's F.C. Barcelona;J. M. Buldu, J. Busquets, I. Echegoyen, F. Seirul. lo;2019/09/19;http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08903v1;The application of Network Science to social systems has introduced newmethodologies to analyze classical problems such as the emergence of epidemics,the arousal of cooperation between individuals or the propagation ofinformation along social networks. More recently, the organization of footballteams and their performance have been unveiled using metrics coming fromNetwork Science, where a team is considered as a complex network whose nodes(i.e., players) interact with the aim of overcoming the opponent network. Here,we combine the use of different network metrics to extract the particularsignature of the F.C. Barcelona coached by Guardiola, which has been consideredone of the best teams along football history. We have first compared thenetwork organization of Guardiola's team with their opponents along one seasonof the Spanish national league, identifying those metrics with statisticallysignificant differences and relating them with the Guardiola's game. Next, wehave focused on the temporal nature of football passing networks and calculatedthe evolution of all network properties along a match, instead of consideringtheir average. In this way, we are able to identify those network metrics thatenhance the probability of scoring/receiving a goal, showing that not all teamsbehave in the same way and how the organization Guardiola's F.C. Barcelona isdifferent from the rest, including its clustering coefficient, shortest-pathlength, largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix, algebraic connectivity andcentrality distribution.
ArXiv;Bigger data, better questions, and a return to fourth down behavior: an  introduction to a special issue on tracking data in the National football  League;Michael J. Lopez;2019/09/23;http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10631v3;Most historical National Football League (NFL) analysis, both mainstream andacademic, has relied on public, play-level data to generate team and playercomparisons. Given the number of oft omitted variables that impact on-fieldresults, such as play call, game situation, and opponent strength, findingstend to be more anecdotal than actionable. With the release of player trackingdata, however, analysts can better ask and answer questions to isolate skilland strategy. In this article, we highlight the limitations of traditionalanalyses, and use a decades-old punching bag for analysts, fourth-downstrategy, as a microcosm for why tracking data is needed. Specifically, weassert that, in absence of using the precise yardage needed for a first down,past findings supporting an aggressive fourth down strategy may have beenoverstated. Next, we synthesize recent work that comprises this special Journalof Quantitative Analysis in Sports issue into player tracking data in football.Finally, we conclude with some best practices and limitations regarding usageof this data. The release of player tracking data marks a transition for theleague and its' analysts, and we hope this issue helps guide innovation infootball analytics for years to come.
ArXiv;Space evaluation in football games via field weighting based on tracking  data;Takuma Narizuka, Yoshihiro Yamazaki, Kenta Takizawa;2020/01/31;http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11629v2;"In football game analysis, space evaluation is an important issue because itis directly related to the quality of ball passing or player formations.Previous studies have primarily focused on a field division approach wherein afield is divided into dominant regions in which a certain player can arriveprior to any other players. However, the field division approach isoversimplified because all locations within a region are regarded as uniformherein. The objective of the current study is to propose a fundamentalframework for space evaluation based on field weighting. In particular, weemployed the motion model and calculated a minimum arrival time $ \tau $ foreach player to all locations on the football field. Our main contribution isthat two variables $ \tau_{\textrm{of}} $ and $ \tau_{\textrm{df}} $corresponding to the minimum arrival time for offense and defense teams areconsidered; using $ \tau_{\textrm{of}} $ and $ \tau_{\textrm{df}} $, neworthogonal variables $ z_{1} $ and $ z_{2} $ are defined. In particular, basedon real datasets comprising of data from 45 football games of the J1 League in2018, we provide a detailed characterization of $ z_{1} $ and $ z_{2} $ interms of ball passing. By using our method, we found that $ z_{1}(\vec{x}, t) $and $ z_{2}(\vec{x}, t) $ represent the degree of safety for a pass made to $\vec{x} $ at $ t $ and degree of sparsity of $ \vec{x} $ at $ t $,respectively; the success probability of passes could be well-fitted using asigmoid function. Moreover, a new type of field division approach andevaluation of ball passing just before shoots using real game data arediscussed."
ArXiv;TiKick: Towards Playing Multi-agent Football Full Games from  Single-agent Demonstrations;Shiyu Huang, Wenze Chen, Longfei Zhang, Shizhen Xu, Ziyang Li, Fengming Zhu, Deheng Ye, Ting Chen, Jun Zhu;2021/10/09;http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04507v5;Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved super-human performance oncomplex video games (e.g., StarCraft II and Dota II). However, current DRLsystems still suffer from challenges of multi-agent coordination, sparserewards, stochastic environments, etc. In seeking to address these challenges,we employ a football video game, e.g., Google Research Football (GRF), as ourtestbed and develop an end-to-end learning-based AI system (denoted as TiKick)to complete this challenging task. In this work, we first generated a largereplay dataset from the self-playing of single-agent experts, which areobtained from league training. We then developed a distributed learning systemand new offline algorithms to learn a powerful multi-agent AI from the fixedsingle-agent dataset. To the best of our knowledge, Tikick is the firstlearning-based AI system that can take over the multi-agent Google ResearchFootball full game, while previous work could either control a single agent orexperiment on toy academic scenarios. Extensive experiments further show thatour pre-trained model can accelerate the training process of the modernmulti-agent algorithm and our method achieves state-of-the-art performances onvarious academic scenarios.
ArXiv;A Validation Procedure for the Estimation of Reachable Regions in  Football;M. Renkin, J. Bischofberger, E. Schikuta, A. Baca;2022/04/07;http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13992v1;Modelling the trajectorial motion of humans along the ground is afoundational task in the quantitative analysis of sports like associationfootball. Most existing models of football player motion have not beenvalidated yet with respect to actual data. One of the reasons for this lack isthat performing such a validation is not straightforward, because models ofplayer motion are usually phrased in a way that emphasises possibly reachablepositions rather than expected positions. Since positional data of footballplayers typically contains outliers, this data may misrepresent the range ofactually reachable positions.  This paper proposes a validation routine for trajectorial motion models thatmeasures and optimises the ability of a motion model to accurately predict allpossibly reachable positions by favoring the smallest predicted area ofreachable positions that encompasses all observed reached positions up to amanually defined threshold. We demonstrate validation and optimisation on fourdifferent motion models, assuming (a) motion with constant speed, (b) motionwith constant acceleration, (c) motion with constant acceleration with a speedlimit, and (d) motion along two segments with constant speed. Our results showthat assuming motion with constant speed or constant acceleration without alimit on the achievable speed is particularly inappropriate for an accuratedistinction between reachable and unreachable locations. Motion along twosegments of constant speed provides by far the highest accuracy among thetested models and serves as an efficient and accurate approximation ofreal-world player motion.
